0,Biography aldous huxley,"Aldous Huxley was an English writer and philosopher. He wrote about fifty books, both fiction and non-fiction works. He also wrote essays, narratives, and poems.
Aldous was born on 26 July 1894 into the famous Huxley family, whose members are known for excelling in science, medicine, arts, and literature. He graduated from Balliol College, Oxford with an undergraduate degree in English literature. Early in his career, he published short stories and poetry and edited the literary magazine Oxford Poetry, before going on to publish travel writing, satire, and screenplays. He spent the latter part of his life in the United States, living in Los Angeles from 1937 until his death. By the end of his life, Huxley was widely recognized for being one of the most prominent intellectuals of his time. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature seven times and was elected Companion of Literature by the Royal Society of Literature in 1962.
Huxley was a humanist and pacifist. He grew interested in philosophical mysticism and universalism, addressing these subjects with works such as The Perennial Philosophy (1945)—which illustrates commonalities between Western and Eastern mysticism. As far as his literary works, his most famous novel Brave New World (1932) has been ranked at number 5 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century by the Modern Library in 1999.
Aldous Huxley died of Laryngeal cancer on November 22, 1963. Media coverage of Huxley's death was overshadowed by the assassination of American President John F.

1,Pearl harbor attack,"The attack on Pearl Harbor or the Battle of Pearl Harbor, the Hawaii Operation was a surprise military strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii Territory, on the morning of December 7, 1941. The attack led to the United States' entry into World War II. The Japanese attack was a preventive action to keep the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions they planned in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States. The attack started at 7:48 and caused serious casualties and widespread damage in the base.
The undeclared assault came as a profound shock to the American people and led directly to the American entry into World War II in both the Pacific and European theaters. The following day, December 8, the United States declared war on Japan. Domestic support for non-interventionism, which had been fading since the Fall of France in 1940, disappeared. Clandestine support of the United Kingdom was replaced by an active alliance. Subsequent operations by the U.S. prompted Germany and Italy to declare war on the U.S. on December 11, which was reciprocated by the U.S. the same day.
The day after the attack, Roosevelt delivered his famous Infamy Speech to a Joint Session of Congress, calling for a formal declaration of war on the Empire of Japan. Congress obliged his request less than an hour later. Roosevelt described the previous day as ""a date which will live in infamy"". The speech is also commonly referred to as the ""Pearl Harbor Speech."" The speech was just a little over seven minutes long. Secretary of State Cordell Hull had recommended that the President devote more time to a fuller exposition of Japanese-American relations and the lengthy but unsuccessful effort to find a peaceful solution. However, Roosevelt kept the speech short in the belief that it would have a more dramatic effect.",attack pearl harbor battl pearl harbor hawaii oper surpris militari strike imperi japanes navi air servic unit state naval base pearl harbor hawaii territori morn decemb attack led unit state entri world war ii japanes attack prevent action keep pacif fleet interf militari action plan southeast asia oversea territori unit kingdom netherland unit state attack start caus seriou casualti widespread damag base undeclar assault came profound shock american peopl led directli american entri world war ii pacif european theater follow day decemb unit state declar war japan domest support fade sinc fall franc disappear clandestin support unit kingdom replac activ allianc subsequ oper prompt germani itali declar war decemb reciproc day day attack roosevelt deliv famou infami speech joint session congress call formal declar war empir japan congress oblig request le hour later roosevelt describ previou day date live infami speech also commonli refer pearl harbor speech speech littl seven minut long secretari state cordel hull recommend presid devot time fuller exposit relat lengthi unsuccess effort find peac solut howev roosevelt kept speech short belief would dramat effect,B2
2,Benefits of fasting,"Fasting is part and parcel of the practices of many religions including, Islam, Judaism and Christianity. Today many are trying to dig up the benefits of fasting. Some people fast for spiritual reasons while others fast as a way to physically discipline the body. Whatever reasons one might come up with, it has been scientifically proved that fasting has tremendous health benefits.
First, fasting is said to play an important role in the detoxification of the body. Detoxification is a normal body process of eliminating or neutralizing toxins through the colon, liver, kidneys, lungs, lymph glands, and skin. This process starts when fasting. Food no longer enters the body and the latter turns to fat reserves for energy. These fat reserves were created when excess glucose and carbohydrates were not used for energy or growth, not excreted, and therefore converted into fat. When the fat reserves are used for energy during a fast, it releases the chemicals from the fatty acids into the system which are then eliminated through the body organs, leading to the cleansing of the whole body.
An other known benefit of fasting is the healing process that is obvious in the body during a fast. When fasting energy is diverted away from the digestive system due to its lack of use and towards the metabolism and immune system. The healing process during a fast is made easy by the body's search for energy sources. Abnormal growths within the body, tumors and the like, do not have the full support of the body's supplies and therefore are more susceptible to disappear.
Fasting also leads to a feeling of rejuvenation and extended life expectancy. This might be due to the detoxification effect of fasting. A study was performed on earthworms that showed the extension of life thanks to fasting. The experiment was performed in the 1930s by isolating one worm and putting it on a cycle of fasting and feeding. The isolated worm outlived the other worms by 19 generations, while still maintaining its freshness and youthful physiological characteristics.",fast part parcel practic mani religion includ islam judaism christian today mani tri dig benefit fast peopl fast spiritu reason other fast way physic disciplin bodi whatev reason one might come scientif prove fast tremend health benefit first fast said play import role detoxif bodi detoxif normal bodi process elimin neutral toxin colon liver kidney lung lymph gland skin process start fast food longer enter bodi latter turn fat reserv energi fat reserv creat excess glucos carbohydr use energi growth excret therefor convert fat fat reserv use energi fast releas chemic fatti acid system elimin bodi organ lead clean whole bodi known benefit fast heal process obviou bodi fast fast energi divert away digest system due lack use toward metabol immun system heal process fast made easi bodi search energi sourc abnorm growth within bodi tumor like full support bodi suppli therefor suscept disappear fast also lead feel rejuven extend life expect might due detoxif effect fast studi perform earthworm show extens life thank fast experi perform isol one worm put cycl fast feed isol worm outliv worm gener still maintain fresh youth physiolog characterist,B1
3,Dolphins sleep,"Since Dolphins are like human being in so many ways. For example, dolphins have a special respiratory just like humans. The only difference is that dolphins are able to stay underwater for a long time without breathing oxygen. But how do dolphins manage to sleep without drowning?
Generally, dolphins sleep with only one brain hemisphere in slow-wave sleep at a time, thus maintaining enough consciousness to breathe and to watch for possible predators and other threats. Earlier sleep stages can occur simultaneously in both hemispheres. In captivity, dolphins seemingly enter a fully asleep state where both eyes are closed and there is no response to mild external stimuli. In this case, respiration is automatic; a tail kick reflex keeps the blowhole above the water if necessary. Anesthetized dolphins initially show a tail kick reflex. Though a similar state has been observed with wild sperm whales, it is not known if dolphins in the wild reach this state. The Indus river dolphin has a sleep method that is different from that of other dolphin species. Living in water with strong currents and potentially dangerous floating debris, it must swim continuously to avoid injury. As a result, this species sleeps in very short bursts which last between 4 and 60 seconds.",sinc dolphin like human mani way exampl dolphin special respiratori like human differ dolphin abl stay underwat long time without breath oxygen dolphin manag sleep without drown gener dolphin sleep one brain hemispher sleep time thu maintain enough conscious breath watch possibl predat threat earlier sleep stage occur simultan hemispher captiv dolphin seemingli enter fulli asleep state eye close respons mild extern stimulus case respir automat tail kick reflex keep blowhol water necessari anesthet dolphin initi show tail kick reflex though similar state observ wild sperm whale known dolphin wild reach state indu river dolphin sleep method differ dolphin speci live water strong current potenti danger float debri must swim continu avoid injuri result speci sleep short burst last second,B2
4,Organizations amnesty international,"Amnesty International is a non-governmental organization (NGO) which focuses on human rights. It is also known as Amnesty and AI and has over 3 million members and supporters around the world. Amnesty International is financed largely by fees and donations from its worldwide membership. It does not accept donations from governments or governmental organizations. It is largely made up of voluntary members, but retains a small number of paid professionals. The objective of the organization is:
""to conduct research and generate action to prevent and end grave abuses of human rights, and to demand justice for those whose rights have been violated.""
Amnesty International was founded in London in 1961, following the publication of the article ""The Forgotten Prisoners"" in The Observer 28 May 1961, by the lawyer Peter Benenson. In this article, Benenson cites the Universal Declaration of Human Rights articles 18 and 19, announced a campaign on ""Appeal for Amnesty, 1961"" and called for ""common action"". Amnesty draws attention to human rights abuses and campaigns for compliance with international laws and standards. It works to mobilize public opinion to put pressure on governments that let abuse take place. The organization was awarded the 1977 Nobel Peace Prize for its ""campaign against torture"", and the United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights in 1978.",amnesti intern organ ngo focus human right also known amnesti ai million member support around world amnesti intern financ larg fee donat worldwid membership accept donat govern government organ larg made voluntari member retain small number paid profession object organ conduct research gener action prevent end grave abus human right demand justic whose right violat amnesti intern found london follow public articl forgotten prison observ may lawyer peter benenson articl benenson cite univers declar human right articl announc campaign appeal amnesti call common action amnesti draw attent human right abus campaign complianc intern law standard work mobil public opinion put pressur govern let abus take place organ award nobel peac prize campaign tortur unit nation prize field human right,C1
5,The old man and the sea,"The Old Man and the Sea is a novel was the last major work of fiction to be written by Ernest Hemingway and published in his lifetime. It is considered to be one of his most famous works and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1953 and was cited by the Nobel Committee as contributing to the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Hemingway in 1954.
The Old Man and the Sea is the story of a battle between an old, experienced Cuban fisherman and a large marlin. The novel opens with the explanation that the fisherman, who is named Santiago, has gone 84 days without catching a fish. In fact, he is so unlucky that his young apprentice, Manolin, has been forbidden by his parents to sail with the old man and been ordered to fish with more successful fishermen. Still dedicated to the old man, however, the boy visits Santiago's shack each night. On the eighty-fifth day, Santiago sets out alone, taking his skiff far onto the Gulf Stream. He sets his lines and, by noon of the first day, a big fish that he is sure is a marlin takes his bait. After a long struggle with the fish Santiago manages to strap the marlin to the side of his skiff and heads home, thinking about the high price the fish will bring him at the market and how many people he will feed. While Santiago sails back back to the shore, sharks are attracted to the trail of blood left by the marlin in the water. Despite his efforts to ward off the sharks, they have almost devoured the marlin's entire carcass, leaving a skeleton consisting mostly of its backbone, its tail and its head. Once home, he slumps onto his bed and falls into a deep sleep. The next day, a group of fishermen gather around the boat where the fish's skeleton is still attached. Manolin, worried during the old man's endeavor, cries upon finding him safe asleep. The boy brings him newspapers and coffee. When the old man wakes, they promise to fish together once again. Upon his return to sleep, Santiago dreams of his youth—of lions on an African beach. The old man feels very unwell and also coughs up blood a few times towards the end of the story. He doesn't tell the boy.
The novel has received so much praise and is considered to be one of the best novels in American literature. Santiago fights the creatures of the sea and some readers think that the story is about man’s battle against the natural world. However, the novel can be viewed as the story of man’s place in relation to nature. In the story, Santiago and the marlin show similar qualities of pride, honor, and bravery, and both are subject to the same eternal natural law - they must kill or be killed. Santiago himself says:
“man is not made for defeat . . . [a] man can be destroyed but not defeated.”",old man sea novel last major work fiction written ernest hemingway publish lifetim consid one famou work award pulitz prize fiction cite nobel committe contribut award nobel prize literatur hemingway old man sea stori battl old experienc cuban fisherman larg marlin novel open explan fisherman name santiago gone day without catch fish fact unlucki young apprentic manolin forbidden parent sail old man order fish success fisherman still dedic old man howev boy visit santiago shack night day santiago set alon take skiff far onto gulf stream set line noon first day big fish sure marlin take bait long struggl fish santiago manag strap marlin side skiff head home think high price fish bring market mani peopl feed santiago sail back back shore shark attract trail blood left marlin water despit effort ward shark almost devour marlin entir carcass leav skeleton consist mostli backbon tail head home slump onto bed fall deep sleep next day group fisherman gather around boat fish skeleton still attach manolin worri old man endeavor cri upon find safe asleep boy bring newspap coffe old man wake promis fish togeth upon return sleep santiago dream lion african beach old man feel unwel also cough blood time toward end stori tell boy novel receiv much prais consid one best novel american literatur santiago fight creatur sea reader think stori man battl natur world howev novel view stori man place relat natur stori santiago marlin show similar qualiti pride honor braveri subject etern natur law must kill kill santiago say man made defeat man destroy defeat,B2
6,What is friendship in simple words,"Develop your reading skills. Read the following text about meditation and do the comprehension questions
Friendship is defined as a bond of affection between two people. People are referred to as best friends if the friendship is really strong. this relationship is characterized by positive interpersonal qualities such as kindness, generosity, loyalty, and honesty. True friends choose to be with one another, enjoy time spent together, and can engage in a positive and supportive role to one another.
As reciprocity, mutual respect, and affection rise, so does the depth of friendship. Consequently, different levels of friendship emerge according to the depth of the relationship.
It's easy to classify acquaintances. They're the people you meet frequently at casual places but don't truly know each other. These are people we know well enough to strike up a conversation with from time to time, but not people we'd ask to a dinner party or contact for help.
You're more inclined to seek help or support from a close buddy. There is not only a high level of trust amongst close friends but also a great deal of genuine love and affection. Even if you disagree with a close friend's decisions, you would protect his or her freedom to make them.
Although best friends are quite rare, they are people whom we need in our lives. Your best friend understands you without much explanation and is always there for you. Your relationship with your best friend is not dependent on the time you spend together. You may not meet your best friends for a long time. But once you get in touch with them, you feel as if nothing has changed in your friendship. These connections are distinct in their ability to adapt to the environment and endure despite the vagaries of life.
Virtual friendship is a relatively new type of friendship. It refers to friendship that takes place on the internet and is unlikely to be connected to real-life interaction. It is contrasted with the traditional friendships that we have listed above. The latter is a form of relationship that requires a lot of face-to-face connection.
This type of friendship developed as a result of advances in technology. The internet, especially social media, played an undeniable role in connecting people worldwide.
According to Doctor Suzanne Degges-White, there are 13 essential traits of good friends:
As Doctor Suzanne Degges-White says, it is probably difficult to find friends endowed with all these thirteen qualities. But as a friend, you have to try to examine your personal habits to discover if you need to improve your friendship.",develop read skill read follow text medit comprehens question friendship defin bond affect two peopl peopl refer best friend friendship realli strong relationship character posit interperson qualiti kind generos loyalti honesti true friend choos one anoth enjoy time spent togeth engag posit support role one anoth reciproc mutual respect affect rise depth friendship consequ differ level friendship emerg accord depth relationship easi classifi acquaint peopl meet frequent casual place truli know peopl know well enough strike convers time time peopl ask dinner parti contact help inclin seek help support close buddi high level trust amongst close friend also great deal genuin love affect even disagre close friend decis would protect freedom make although best friend quit rare peopl need live best friend understand without much explan alway relationship best friend depend time spend togeth may meet best friend long time get touch feel noth chang friendship connect distinct abil adapt environ endur despit vagari life virtual friendship rel new type friendship refer friendship take place internet unlik connect interact contrast tradit friendship list latter form relationship requir lot connect type friendship develop result advanc technolog internet especi social medium play undeni role connect peopl worldwid accord doctor suzann essenti trait good friend doctor suzann say probabl difficult find friend endow thirteen qualiti friend tri examin person habit discov need improv friendship,B2
7,Ancient egypt civilization,"Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeastern Africa, which followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150Â BC with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Menes. The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable Kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods:
Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power in the New Kingdom, during the Ramesside period, where it rivaled the Hittite Empire, Assyrian Empire, and Mitanni Empire
The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the Nile River valley for agriculture. The predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops, which supported a more dense population, and social development and culture. The development of ancient Egypt was also due to a very advanced system of administration. The contributions of ancient Egypt include:
The ancient Egyptians also had a military intended to defeat foreign enemies and assert Egyptian dominance.
Motivating and organizing the administrative activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes, religious leaders, and administrators under the control of a pharaoh, who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of religious beliefs. This system of administration resulted in outstanding achievements. These include:
Egypt left a lasting legacy. Its art and architecture were widely copied, and its antiquities carried off to far corners of the world. Its monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of travelers and writers for centuries. A new-found respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period by Europeans and Egyptians led to the scientific investigation of Egyptian civilization and a greater appreciation of its cultural legacy.
After reaching the pinnacle of its power in the New Kingdom, during the Ramesside period, ancient Egypt entered a period of slow decline. Egypt was invaded or conquered by a succession of foreign powers, such as the Canaanites/Hyksos, Libyans, the Nubians, the Assyrians, Babylonians, the Achaemenid Persians, and the Macedonians in the Third Intermediate Period and the Late Period of Egypt. In the aftermath of Alexander the Great's death, one of his generals, Ptolemy Soter, established himself as the new ruler of Egypt. This Greek Ptolemaic Kingdom ruled Egypt until 30Â BC, when, under Cleopatra, it fell to the Roman Empire and became a Roman province.",ancient egypt civil ancient northeastern africa follow prehistor egypt coalesc around bc polit unif upper lower egypt mene histori ancient egypt occur seri stabl kingdom separ period rel instabl known intermedi period egypt reach pinnacl power new kingdom ramessid period rival hittit empir assyrian empir mitanni empir success ancient egyptian civil came partli abil adapt condit nile river valley agricultur predict flood control irrig fertil valley produc surplu crop support den popul social develop cultur develop ancient egypt also due advanc system administr contribut ancient egypt includ ancient egyptian also militari intend defeat foreign enemi assert egyptian domin motiv organ administr activ bureaucraci elit scribe religi leader administr control pharaoh ensur cooper uniti egyptian peopl context elabor system religi belief system administr result outstand achiev includ egypt left last legaci art architectur wide copi antiqu carri far corner world monument ruin inspir imagin travel writer centuri respect antiqu excav earli modern period european egyptian led scientif investig egyptian civil greater appreci cultur legaci reach pinnacl power new kingdom ramessid period ancient egypt enter period slow declin egypt invad conquer success foreign power libyan nubian assyrian babylonian achaemenid persian macedonian third intermedi period late period egypt aftermath alexand great death one gener ptolemi soter establish new ruler egypt greek ptolema kingdom rule egypt bc cleopatra fell roman empir becam roman provinc,B2
8,English educational system,"Education is a devolved matter in the UK, with separate systems overseen by separate governments. England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, with certain exceptions, follow the National Curriculum of the United Kingdom. Scotland, on the other hand, has its own set of educational standards.
The Department for Education in the United Kingdom is in charge of education in England. Local government officials are in charge of putting public education and state-funded schools policies into action on a local level.
The English educational system is divided into primary, secondary, and higher education. Children are required to start school at the age of five. Compulsory education lasts until the age of sixteen. Most pupils transfer from primary to secondary education at the age of eleven.
Students may then continue their secondary studies for a further two years (sixth form), leading most typically to an A level qualification, although other qualifications and courses exist, including Business and Technology Education Council (BTEC) qualifications and the International Baccalaureate.
Higher education typically begins with a 3-year Bachelor's Degree. Postgraduate degrees include Master's Degrees, either taught or by research, and Doctor of Philosophy, a research degree that usually takes at least 3 years.",educ devolv matter uk separ system overseen separ govern england wale northern ireland certain except follow nation curriculum unit kingdom scotland hand set educ standard depart educ unit kingdom charg educ england local govern offici charg put public educ school polici action local level english educ system divid primari secondari higher educ child requir start school age five compulsori educ last age sixteen pupil transfer primari secondari educ age eleven student may continu secondari studi two year sixth form lead typic level qualif although qualif cours exist includ busi technolog educ council btec qualif intern baccalaur higher educ typic begin bachelor degre postgradu degre includ master degre either taught research doctor philosophi research degre usual take least year,C1
9,Winter olympic games,"The Winter Olympic Games is a major international sporting event that occurs once every four years. The first Winter Olympics, the 1924 Winter Olympics, was held in Chamonix, France. The original sports were alpine and cross-country skiing, figure skating, ice hockey, Nordic combined, ski jumping and speed skating.

The Games were held every four years from 1924 until 1936, after which they were interrupted by World War II. The Olympics resumed in 1948 and was again held every four years. Until 1992, the Winter and Summer Olympic Games were held in the same years, but in accordance with a 1986 decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to place the Summer and Winter Games on separate four-year cycles in alternating even-numbered years, the next Winter Olympics after 1992 was in 1994.
The Winter Olympics has been hosted on three continents by eleven different countries, but never in a country in the southern hemisphere.",winter olymp game major intern sport event occur everi four year first winter olymp winter olymp held chamonix franc origin sport alpin ski figur skate ice hockey nordic combin ski jump speed skate game held everi four year interrupt world war ii olymp resum held everi four year winter summer olymp game held year accord decis intern olymp committe ioc place summer winter game separ cycl altern year next winter olymp winter olymp host three contin eleven differ countri never countri southern hemispher,B1
10,Thomas edison,"Thomas Alva Edison was an American inventor and businessman. He was born on February 11, 1847. His mother taught him at home. Much of his education came from reading R.G. Parker's School of Natural Philosophy and The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art. Edison developed hearing problems at an early age. The cause of his deafness has been attributed to a bout of scarlet fever during childhood and recurring untreated middle-ear infections.
Edison developed many skills when he was young. He sold candy and newspapers on trains running from Port Huron to Detroit and sold vegetables to supplement his income. He also studied qualitative analysis and conducted chemical experiments on the train until an accident prohibited further work of the kind. Later, Edison obtained the exclusive right to sell newspapers on the road. This began Edison's long streak of entrepreneurial ventures, as he discovered his talents as a businessman. These talents eventually led him to found 14 companies, including General Electric, which is still one of the largest publicly traded companies in the world.
He developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and the long-lasting, practical electric light bulb. Dubbed ""The Wizard of Menlo Park"", he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large-scale teamwork to the process of invention, and because of that, he is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory.
Edison died of complications of diabetes on October 18, 1931, in his home, ""Glenmont"" in Llewellyn Park in West Orange, New Jersey, which he had purchased in 1886 as a wedding gift for Mina, his second wife. He is buried behind the home.",thoma alva edison american inventor businessman born februari mother taught home much educ came read parker school natur philosophi cooper union advanc scienc art edison develop hear problem earli age caus deaf attribut bout scarlet fever childhood recur untreat infect edison develop mani skill young sold candi newspap train run port huron detroit sold veget supplement incom also studi qualit analysi conduct chemic experi train accid prohibit work kind later edison obtain exclus right sell newspap road began edison long streak entrepreneuri ventur discov talent businessman talent eventu led found compani includ gener electr still one largest publicli trade compani world develop mani devic greatli influenc life around world includ phonograph motion pictur camera practic electr light bulb dub wizard menlo park one first inventor appli principl mass product teamwork process invent often credit creation first industri research laboratori edison die complic diabet octob home glenmont llewellyn park west orang new jersey purchas wed gift mina second wife buri behind home,C1
11,Mary shelley biography,"Mary Shelley was an English novelist, short story writer, dramatist, essayist, biographer, and travel write. She was born on August thirtieth, 1797, and is best known for her Gothic novel Frankenstein: or, The Modern Prometheus (1818). She also edited and promoted the works of her husband, the Romantic poet and philosopher Percy Bysshe Shelley. Her father was the political philosopher William Godwin, and her mother was the philosopher and feminist Mary Wollstonecraft.
After their mother's death, Mary and her older half-sister, Fanny Imlay, were reared by their father. When Mary was four, Godwin married his neighbour, Mary Jane Clairmont. Godwin provided his daughter with a rich, if informal, education, encouraging her to adhere to his liberal political theories. In 1814, Mary Godwin began a romantic relationship with one of her father’s political followers, the married Percy Bysshe Shelley. Together with Mary's stepsister, Claire Clairmont, they left for France and travelled through Europe. When they returned to England, Mary was pregnant with Percy's child. Over the next two years, she and Percy faced ostracism, constant debt, and the death of their prematurely born daughter. They married in late 1816 after the suicide of Percy Shelley's first wife, Harriet.
In 1816, the couple famously spent a summer with Lord Byron, John William Polidori, and Claire Clairmont near Geneva, Switzerland, where Mary conceived the idea for her novel Frankenstein. The family left Britain in 1818 for Italy, where their second and third children died before Mary Shelley gave birth to her last and only surviving child, Percy Florence Shelley. In 1822, her husband drowned when his sailing boat sank during a storm near Viareggio. A year later, Mary Shelley returned to England and from then on devoted herself to the upbringing of her son and a career as a professional author. The last decade of her life was dogged by illness, probably caused by the brain tumor that was to kill her at the age of 53 on February first, 1851.
Until the 1970s, Mary Shelley was known mainly for her efforts to publish her husband's works and for her novel Frankenstein, which remains widely read and has inspired many theatrical and film adaptations. Recently scholars have shown increasing interest in her other literary output, particularly in her novels, which include the historical novels Valperga (1823) and Perkin Warbeck (1830), the apocalyptic novel The Last Man (1826), and her final two novels, Lodore (1835) and Falkner (1837).",mari shelley english novelist short stori writer dramatist essayist biograph travel write born august thirtieth best known gothic novel frankenstein modern prometheu also edit promot work husband romant poet philosoph perci byssh shelley father polit philosoph william godwin mother philosoph feminist mari wollstonecraft mother death mari older fanni imlay rear father mari four godwin marri neighbour mari jane clairmont godwin provid daughter rich inform educ encourag adher liber polit theori mari godwin began romant relationship one father polit follow marri perci byssh shelley togeth mari stepsist clair clairmont left franc travel europ return england mari pregnant perci child next two year perci face ostrac constant debt death prematur born daughter marri late suicid perci shelley first wife harriet coupl famous spent summer lord byron john william polidori clair clairmont near geneva switzerland mari conceiv idea novel frankenstein famili left britain itali second third child die mari shelley gave birth last surviv child perci florenc shelley husband drown sail boat sank storm near viareggio year later mari shelley return england devot upbring son career profession author last decad life dog ill probabl caus brain tumor kill age februari first mari shelley known mainli effort publish husband work novel frankenstein remain wide read inspir mani theatric film adapt recent scholar shown increas interest literari output particularli novel includ histor novel valperga perkin warbeck apocalypt novel last man final two novel lodor falkner,B2
12,Cloud computing,"Cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive. It involves computing over a network, where a program or application may run on many connected computers at the same time.
For some, cloud computing is a metaphor for the Internet. It typically uses connected hardware machines called servers. Individual users can use the server's processing power to run an application, store data, or perform any other computing task. Thus, instead of using a personal computer every-time to run the application, the individual can now run the application from anywhere in the world.
For businesses, cloud computing is an ideal way to reduce expenses. For example, companies may buy services in the cloud. That is to say, instead of installing applications on every single computer in the company, cloud computing would allow workers to log into a Web-based service (a cloud) which hosts all the programs individual users would need for their job. Everything would run on remote machines and local computers task would rely just on connecting to those machines.
While cloud computing, could change the entire computer industry, there are still some concerns about the security of the data stored on the remote machines. It is true that it promises to offload many tasks. However, this technology raises a fundamental question. Is it safe to store one's data on someone else's computer? The cloud service provider needs to establish clear and relevant policies that describe how the data of each cloud user will be accessed and used.

It is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates ""rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular"", which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually over a backbeat or musical accompaniment.
The components of rap include:
Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that rap is usually performed in time to an instrumental track. Rap is often associated with and is a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon predate hip-hop culture.
Rap is usually delivered over a beat, typically provided by a DJ (abbreviation of Disc Jockey), turntablist, Beatboxer, or performed A capella without accompaniment. Stylistically, rap occupies a gray area between speech, prose, poetry, and singing.
The word 'rap' predates the musical form. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary gives a date of 1541 for the first recorded use of the word 'rap 'with the meaning ""to utter (esp. an oath) sharply, vigorously, or suddenly."" The word is now used to describe quick speech or repartee. It had been used in British English since the 16th century. It was part of the African American dialect of English in the 1960s meaning ""to converse"", and very soon after that in its present usage as a term denoting the musical style. Today, the term rap is so closely associated with hip-hop music that many writers use the terms interchangeably.
The earliest precursor to the modern rap is the West African griot (i.e. a West African historian, storyteller, praise singer, poet, or musician.) tradition, in which ""oral historians"", or ""praise-singers"", would disseminate oral traditions and genealogies, or use their formidable rhetorical techniques for gossip or to ""praise or critique individuals."" Griot traditions connect to rap along a lineage of Black verbal reverence that goes back to ancient Egyptian practices, through James Brown interacting with the crowd and the band between songs, to Muhammad Ali's quick-witted verbal taunts and the palpitating poems of the Last Poets. Therefore, rap lyrics and music are part of the ""Black rhetorical continuum"", and aim to reuse elements of past traditions while expanding upon them through creative use of language and rhetorical styles and strategies. The person credited with originating the style of delivering rhymes over extensive music, that would become known as rap, was Anthony Holloway, better known as DJ Hollywood, from Harlem, New York.
Rap music has often been subject to criticism, especially for the issues rappers tackle in their songs. Other than some social issues, the main subject is violence and drugs.",rap music style popular music develop disc jockey urban black late music form vocal deliveri incorpor rhyme rhythmic speech street vernacular perform chant varieti way usual backbeat music accompani compon rap includ rap differ poetri rap usual perform time instrument track rap often associ primari ingredi music origin phenomenon predat cultur rap usual deliv beat typic provid dj abbrevi disc jockey turntablist beatbox perform capella without accompani stylist rap occupi gray area speech prose poetri sing word predat music form shorter oxford english dictionari give date first record use word mean utter esp oath sharpli vigor suddenli word use describ quick speech reparte use british english sinc centuri part african american dialect english mean convers soon present usag term denot music style today term rap close associ music mani writer use term interchang earliest precursor modern rap west african griot west african historian storytel prais singer poet musician tradit oral historian would dissemin oral tradit genealog use formid rhetor techniqu gossip prais critiqu individu griot tradit connect rap along lineag black verbal rever goe back ancient egyptian practic jame brown interact crowd band song muhammad ali verbal taunt palpit poem last poet therefor rap lyric music part black rhetor continuum aim reus element past tradit expand upon creativ use languag rhetor style strategi person credit origin style deliv rhyme extens music would becom known rap anthoni holloway better known dj hollywood harlem new york rap music often subject critic especi issu rapper tackl song social issu main subject violenc drug,C1
14,Youth,"Juvenile delinquency refers to antisocial or illegal behavior by children or adolescents and is considered a serious problem all over the world. It is caused by social, economic and cultural factors. This juvenile criminality is apparent in marginal sectors of urban areas where children are exposed to violence in their immediate social environment, either as observers or as victims. Because delinquents basic education, if they have any, is poor they have been marginalized from society and destitute of any dignity or self esteem. Although most legal systems prescribe specific procedures for dealing with young criminals, such as juvenile detention centers and suppression, approaches to prevent youth from becoming delinquent should also include measures to instill equality and justice, fight poverty and create an atmosphere of hope and peace among youth. These preventive policies should be given priorities over any coercive measures.
Socioeconomic opportunities and administrative services should be provided in rural areas to discourage young people from migrating to urban areas. Similarly, youth from poor urban settings should benefit from plans that focus on education, employment and access to leisure programs , especially during long school holidays. Young people who drop out of school or come from broken families should have access to specific social programs that help them become responsible adults.
Information campaigns should be planned to sensitize youth to be aware of the detrimental effects of violence on the family, community and society, to teach them how to communicate without violence. Focus on the importance of family should become a priority because it is the primary institution of socialization of youth and continues to play an important role in the prevention of juvenile delinquency and underage crime.",juvenil delinqu refer antisoci illeg behavior child adolesc consid seriou problem world caus social econom cultur factor juvenil crimin appar margin sector urban area child expo violenc immedi social environ either observ victim delinqu basic educ poor margin societi destitut digniti self esteem although legal system prescrib specif procedur deal young crimin juvenil detent center suppress approach prevent youth becom delinqu also includ measur instil equal justic fight poverti creat atmospher hope peac among youth prevent polici given prioriti coerciv measur socioeconom opportun administr servic provid rural area discourag young peopl migrat urban area similarli youth poor urban set benefit plan focu educ employ access leisur program especi long school holiday young peopl drop school come broken famili access specif social program help becom respons adult inform campaign plan sensit youth awar detriment effect violenc famili commun societi teach commun without violenc focu import famili becom prioriti primari institut social youth continu play import role prevent juvenil delinqu underag crime,C1
15,World war 1,"On June 1914, Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary. This set off a diplomatic crisis when Austria-Hungary delivered an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia, a series of ten demands that were made intentionally unacceptable, in an effort to provoke a war with Serbia. International alliances formed and within weeks, the major powers were at war.
The conflict soon spread around the world. Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire formed the so-called Central Powers against Great Britain, France, Russia, Italy and Japan formed the Allied Powers. Later, the United States joined the Allies in 1917 .
More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over 9 million combatants and 7 million civilians died as a result of this global war, a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication. Armies used modern weaponry such as machine guns, tanks and chemical weapons. The tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare also added to the unprecedented number of victims. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.
By the end of the war on November 11th, 1918, the German Empire, Russian Empire, Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire ceased to exist. National borders were redrawn, with several independent nations restored or created, and Germany's colonies were parceled out among the winners. During the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, the Big Four (Britain, France, the United States and Italy) imposed their terms in a series of treaties. The League of Nations was formed with the aim of preventing any repetition of such a conflict. This effort failed, and economic depression, renewed European nationalism, weakened member states, and the German feeling of humiliation contributed to the rise of Nazism. These conditions eventually contributed to World War II.",june yugoslav nationalist gavrilo princip assassin archduk franz ferdinand austria heir throne set diplomat crisi deliv ultimatum kingdom serbia seri ten demand made intent unaccept effort provok war serbia intern allianc form within week major power war conflict soon spread around world germani ottoman empir form central power great britain franc russia itali japan form alli power later unit state join alli million militari personnel includ million european mobilis one largest war histori million combat million civilian die result global war casualti rate exacerb belliger technolog industri sophist armi use modern weaponri machin gun tank chemic weapon tactic stalem caus gruell trench warfar also ad unpreced number victim one deadliest conflict histori pave way major polit chang includ revolut mani nation involv end war novemb german empir russian empir empir ottoman empir ceas exist nation border redrawn sever independ nation restor creat germani coloni parcel among winner pari peac confer big four britain franc unit state itali impos term seri treati leagu nation form aim prevent repetit conflict effort fail econom depress renew european nation weaken member state german feel humili contribut rise nazism condit eventu contribut world war ii,C2
16,Viking series,"Develop your reading skills. Read the following text about the Vikings Series!
VikingsÂ is a historical drama television series created and written by Michael Hirst for theÂ HistoryÂ channel. It was filmed in Ireland and is inspired by the sagas of VikingÂ Ragnar Lothbrok, one of the best-known legendary Norse heroes and notorious as the scourge of England and France.
The show portrays Ragnar as a farmer who rises to fame by successful raids into England and eventually becomes a Scandinavian King, with the support of his family and fellow warriors. In the later seasons, the series follows the fortunes of his sons and their adventures in England, Scandinavia and the Mediterranean.
The series is inspired by the tales of the Norsemen of early medieval Scandinavia, as notably laid down in the 13th-century sagasÂ Ragnars saga LoÃ°brÃ³karÂ andÂ Ragnarssona Ã¾Ã¡ttr, as well as in Saxo Grammaticus's 12th-century workÂ Gesta Danorum. It is worthwhile mentioning that Norse legendary sagas were partially fictional tales based in the Norse oral tradition, written down about 200 to 400 years after the events they describe. Further inspiration is taken from historical sources of the period, such as records of the Viking raid on Lindisfarne depicted in the second episode, or Ahmad ibn Fadlan's 10th-century account of the Varangians. The series begins at the start of the Viking Age, marked by the Lindisfarne raid in 793.
The cast includes, among others, Travis Fimmel as Ragnar Lothbrok (seasons 1â€“4), Katheryn Winnick as Lagertha, Clive Standen as Rollo (seasons 1â€“4; recurring season 5), Jessalyn Gilsig as Siggy (seasons 1â€“3), Gustaf SkarsgÃ¥rd as Floki.
Although the series was criticized for a lack of historical accuracy in some scenes, it received favorable reviews. According to Nielsen, the series premiere drew six million viewers in the US, topping all broadcast networks among viewers aged 18 to 49. It also premiered on March 3, 2013, in Canada and the United States.",develop read skill read follow text vike seri vikingsâ histor drama televis seri creat written michael hirst theâ historyâ channel film ireland inspir saga vikingâ ragnar lothbrok one legendari nors hero notori scourg england franc show portray ragnar farmer rise fame success raid england eventu becom scandinavian king support famili fellow warrior later season seri follow fortun son adventur england scandinavia mediterranean seri inspir tale norseman earli mediev scandinavia notabl laid sagasâ ragnar saga andâ ragnarssona well saxo grammaticu workâ gesta danorum worthwhil mention nors legendari saga partial fiction tale base nors oral tradit written year event describ inspir taken histor sourc period record vike raid lindisfarn depict second episod ahmad ibn fadlan account varangian seri begin start vike age mark lindisfarn raid cast includ among other travi fimmel ragnar lothbrok season katheryn winnick lagertha clive standen rollo season recur season jessalyn gilsig siggi season gustaf floki although seri critic lack histor accuraci scene receiv favor review accord nielsen seri premier drew six million viewer u top broadcast network among viewer age also premier march canada unit state,B2
17,Wall of china,"The Great Wall of China, one of the greatest wonders of the world, was first built between 220–206 BC. In fact, it began as independent walls for different states when it was first built, and did not become the ""Great"" wall until the Qin Dynasty. Emperor Qin Shihuang succeeded in his effort to have the walls joined together to serve as fortification to protect the northern borders of the Chinese Empire from invasion. Afterwards it was rebuilt and maintained over the years, between the 5th century BC and the 16th century.
One of the myths associated with the Great Wall of China is that it is the only man-made structure that can be seen from the moon with the naked eye. The legend originated in Richard Halliburton's 1938 book Second Book of Marvels. However, This myth is simply not true. Richard Halliburton's claim was contradicted by astronauts Neil Armstrongby and Yang Liwei. A more plausible assumption would be to say that the Great Wall can be visible from a low orbit of the earth which is not unique in this regard as many other artificial constructions can be seen from that height.",great wall china one greatest wonder world first built bc fact began independ wall differ state first built becom great wall qin dynasti emperor qin shihuang succeed effort wall join togeth serv fortif protect northern border chine empir invas afterward rebuilt maintain year centuri bc centuri one myth associ great wall china structur seen moon nake eye legend origin richard halliburton book second book marvel howev myth simpli true richard halliburton claim contradict astronaut neil armstrongbi yang liwei plausibl assumpt would say great wall visibl low orbit earth uniqu regard mani artifici construct seen height,B2
18,Atlantis plato story,"Was Atlantis real? The mythical island of Atlantis has often been depicted in creative works such as films, books and paintings, but the origin of the story come from Timaeus, a Socratic dialogue, written in about 360 B.C. by Plato.
The Timaeus begins with an introduction, followed by an account of the creations and structure of the universe and ancient civilizations. In the introduction, Socrates muses about the perfect society, described in Plato's Republic (c. 380 BC), and wonders if he and his guests might recollect a story which exemplifies such a society. Critias mentions an allegedly historical tale that would make the perfect example, and follows by describing Atlantis as is recorded in the Critias. In his account, ancient Athens seems to represent the ""perfect society"" and Atlantis its opponent, representing the very antithesis of the ""perfect"" traits described in the Republic.
Atlantis is described in Timaeus as follows :
For it is related in our records how once upon a time your State stayed the course of a mighty host, which, starting from a distant point in the Atlantic ocean, was insolently advancing to attack the whole of Europe, and Asia to boot. For the ocean there was at that time navigable; for in front of the mouth which you Greeks call, as you say, 'the pillars of Heracles,' there lay an island which was larger than Libya and Asia together; and it was possible for the travelers of that time to cross from it to the other islands, and from the islands to the whole of the continent over against them which encompasses that veritable ocean. For all that we have here, lying within the mouth of which we speak, is evidently a haven having a narrow entrance; but that yonder is a real ocean, and the land surrounding it may most rightly be called, in the fullest and truest sense, a continent. Now in this island of Atlantis there existed a confederation of kings, of great and marvelous power, which held sway over all the island, and over many other islands also and parts of the continent.
According to Critias, 9,000 years before his lifetime a war took place between those outside the Pillars of Hercules at the Strait of Gibraltar and those who dwelt within them. The Atlanteans had conquered the parts of Libya within the Pillars of Hercules as far as Egypt and the European continent as far as Tyrrhenia, and subjected its people to slavery. The Athenians led an alliance of resistors against the Atlantean empire, and as the alliance disintegrated, prevailed alone against the empire, liberating the occupied lands.
But at a later time there occurred portentous earthquakes and floods, and one grievous day and night befell them, when the whole body of your warriors was swallowed up by the earth, and the island of Atlantis in like manner was swallowed up by the sea and vanished; wherefore also the ocean at that spot has now become impassable and unsearchable, being blocked up by the shoal mud which the island created as it settled down",atlanti real mythic island atlanti often depict creativ work film book paint origin stori come timaeu socrat dialogu written plato timaeu begin introduct follow account creation structur univers ancient civil introduct socrat muse perfect societi describ plato republ bc wonder guest might recollect stori exemplifi societi critia mention allegedli histor tale would make perfect exampl follow describ atlanti record critia account ancient athen seem repres perfect societi atlanti oppon repres antithesi perfect trait describ republ atlanti describ timaeu follow relat record upon time state stay cours mighti host start distant point atlant ocean insol advanc attack whole europ asia boot ocean time navig front mouth greek call say pillar heracl lay island larger libya asia togeth possibl travel time cross island island whole contin encompass verit ocean lie within mouth speak evid narrow entranc yonder real ocean land surround may rightli call fullest truest sen contin island atlanti exist confeder king great marvel power held sway island mani island also part contin accord critia year lifetim war took place outsid pillar hercul strait gibraltar dwelt within atlantean conquer part libya within pillar hercul far egypt european contin far tyrrhenia subject peopl slaveri athenian led allianc resistor atlantean empir allianc disintegr prevail alon empir liber occupi land later time occur portent earthquak flood one grievou day night befel whole bodi warrior swallow earth island atlanti like manner swallow sea vanish wherefor also ocean spot becom impass unsearch block shoal mud island creat settl,C1

21,Romeo and juliet summary,"This is a short summary of Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare. The play which is set in Verona is a story about a long feud between the Montague and Capulet families. This feud causes tragic results for the main characters in the play, Romeo and Juliet.

Nevertheless, helped by Friar Laurence, they marry in secret instead. Unfortunately, before their wedding night Romeo kills Juliet's cousin in a duel, and in the morning he is forced to leave her. If he ever returns to the city, he will be put to death.
Juliet's parents told her she must marry Paris. Her parents do not know she is already married. She refuses in the beginning, but later agrees because she plans to fake her death and escape to be with Romeo forever; again with the help of Friar Laurence.
Frair Laurence designs the plan. He gives Juliet a sleeping potion. She appears to be dead and was put in a tomb. However, Romeo does not know about the plan, visits her grave, thinks she is dead, and kills himself.

22,Virginia woolf,"Virginia Woolf was an English author, feminist, essayist, publisher, and critic, considered as one of the foremost modernists of the twentieth century along with T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, James Joyce, and Gertrude Stein. Her parents were Sir Leslie Stephen (1832–1904), who was a notable historian, author, critic and mountaineer, and Julia Prinsep Duckworth (1846–1895), a renowned beauty. According to Woolf's memoirs, her most vivid childhood memories were not of London but of St. Ives in Cornwall, where the family spent every summer until 1895. This place inspired her to write one of her masterpieces, To the Lighthouse.
The sudden death of her mother in 1895, when Virginia was 13, and that of her half-sister Stella two years later, led to the first of Virginia's several nervous breakdowns. but it was the death of her father in 1904 provoked her most alarming collapse and she was briefly institutionalised. Some scholars have suggested that her mental instability was also due to the sexual abuse to which she and her sister Vanessa were subjected by their half-brothers George and Gerald Duckworth.
Woolf came to know the founders of the the Bloomsbury Group. She became an active member of this literary circle. Later, Virginia Stephen married writer Leonard Woolf on 10 August 1912. Despite his low material status (Woolf referring to Leonard during their engagement as a ""penniless Jew"") the couple shared a close bond.
Virginia's most famous works include the novels Mrs Dalloway (1925), To the Lighthouse (1927) and Orlando (1928), and the book-length essay A Room of One's Own (1929), with its famous dictum, ""A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction."" In some of her novels she moves away from the use of plot and structure to employ stream-of-consciousness to emphasise the psychological aspects of her characters.
After completing the manuscript of her last (posthumously published) novel, Between the Acts, Woolf fell into a depression similar to that which she had earlier experienced. On 28 March 1941, Woolf put on her overcoat, filled its pockets with stones, and walked into the River Ouse near her home and drowned herself. Woolf's body was not found until 18 April 1941. Her husband buried her cremated remains under an elm in the garden of Monk's House, their home in Rodmell, Sussex.
Her final writing were these words addressed to her husband:
""I know that I am spoiling your life, that without me you could work. And you will I know. You see I can't even write this properly. I can't read. What I want to say is I owe all the happiness of my life to you. You have been entirely patient with me and incredibly good. I want to say that—everybody knows it. If anybody could have saved me it would have been you. Everything has gone from me but the certainty of your goodness. I can't go on spoiling your life any longer.

23,Addiction definition types treatment,"Addiction can be defined as a brain disorder identified by compulsive engagement in rewarding stimuli despite unfavorable consequences. Two factors determine any type of addiction. These are the psychological and biological processes involved in the addictive behavior. The biological process is induced by repeated exposure to an addictive stimulus and is the core pathology that drives the development and maintenance of an addiction. At the psychological level, the cognitive control, and particularly inhibitory control over behavior, is impaired in addiction.
Two properties are involved in all addictive stimuli. They are reinforcing and intrinsically rewarding. Addictive stimuli are reinforcing because they increase the likelihood that a person will seek repeated exposure to them. They are also intrinsically rewarding since they are perceived as being inherently positive, desirable, and pleasurable. The pleasure felt by addiction leads to a particularly powerful increase of dopamine. The latter is a neurotransmitter that sends signals to nerve cells in the brain. Addictive behavior provides a shortcut to the brain's reward system by flooding the brain with dopamine. This mechanism increases the likelihood of craving for the object of addiction and losing complete control over its use.
As described by two groups of researchers, addiction causes an ""astoundingly high financial and human toll"" on individuals and society as a whole through the direct adverse effects of drugs, associated healthcare costs, long-term complications, the functional consequences of altered neural plasticity in the brain, and the consequent loss of productivity. Classic hallmarks of addiction include impaired control over substances or behavior, preoccupation with substance or behavior, and continued use despite consequences. Habits and patterns associated with addiction are typically characterized by immediate gratification (short-term reward), coupled with delayed deleterious effects (long-term costs).
Examples of drug and behavioral addictions include alcoholism, amphetamine addiction, cocaine addiction, nicotine addiction, opiate addiction, food addiction, gambling addiction, computer addiction, and sexual addiction.
In order to be effective, all pharmacological or biologically (i.e. medication) based treatments for addiction need to be integrated into other established forms of addiction rehabilitation, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and individual and group psychotherapy. Research suggests that cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, and a community reinforcement approach were effective interventions with moderate effect sizes. Evidence also indicates that consistent aerobic exercise, especially endurance exercise such as marathon running, actually prevents the development of certain drug addictions",addict defin brain disord identifi compuls engag reward stimulus despit unfavor consequ two factor determin type addict psycholog biolog process involv addict behavior biolog process induc repeat exposur addict stimulu core patholog drive develop mainten addict psycholog level cognit control particularli inhibitori control behavior impair addict two properti involv addict stimulus reinforc intrins reward addict stimulus reinforc increas likelihood person seek repeat exposur also intrins reward sinc perceiv inher posit desir pleasur pleasur felt addict lead particularli power increas dopamin latter neurotransmitt send signal nerv cell brain addict behavior provid shortcut brain reward system flood brain dopamin mechan increas likelihood crave object addict lose complet control use describ two group research addict caus astoundingli high financi human toll individu societi whole direct advers effect drug associ healthcar cost complic function consequ alter neural plastic brain consequ loss product classic hallmark addict includ impair control substanc behavior preoccup substanc behavior continu use despit consequ habit pattern associ addict typic character immedi gratif reward coupl delay deleteri effect cost exampl drug behavior addict includ alcohol amphetamin addict cocain addict nicotin addict opiat addict food addict gambl addict comput addict sexual addict order effect pharmacolog biolog medic base treatment addict need integr establish form addict rehabilit cognit behavior therapi individu group psychotherapi research suggest cognit behavior therapi motiv interview commun reinforc approach effect intervent moder effect size evid also indic consist aerob exercis especi endur exercis marathon run actual prevent develop certain drug addict,B2
24,Coffee history,"The history of coffee
The origin of coffee as a drink or a plant dates back to the middle the of the 15th century in the Sufi Muslim monasteries around Mocha in Yemen. It was in Arabia that coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed, in a similar way to how it is now prepared. By the 16th century, it had reached the rest of the Middle East, Persia, Turkey, and northern Africa.
The first coffee smuggled out of the Middle East was by Sufi Baba Budan from Yemen to India in 1670. Before then, all exported coffee was boiled or otherwise sterilized. Portraits of Baba Budan depict him as having smuggled seven coffee seeds by strapping them to his chest. The first plants grown from these smuggled seeds were planted in Mysore, in the state of Karnataka, India. Coffee then spread to Italy, and to the rest of Europe, to Indonesia, and to the Americas.
When coffee reached North America during the Colonial period, it was initially not as successful as it had been in Europe as alcoholic beverages remained more popular. During the Revolutionary War, the demand for coffee increased so much that dealers had to hoard their scarce supplies and raise prices dramatically.
Coffee was introduced to Brazil in 1727, although its cultivation did not gather momentum until independence in 1822. After this time massive tracts of rainforest were cleared for coffee plantations, first in the vicinity of Rio de Janeiro and later São Paulo.",histori coffe origin coffe drink plant date back middl centuri sufi muslim monasteri around mocha yemen arabia coffe seed first roast brew similar way prepar centuri reach rest middl east persia turkey northern africa first coffe smuggl middl east sufi baba budan yemen india export coffe boil otherwis steril portrait baba budan depict smuggl seven coffe seed strap chest first plant grown smuggl seed plant mysor state karnataka india coffe spread itali rest europ indonesia america coffe reach north america coloni period initi success europ alcohol beverag remain popular revolutionari war demand coffe increas much dealer hoard scarc suppli rais price dramat coffe introduc brazil although cultiv gather momentum independ time massiv tract rainforest clear coffe plantat first vicin rio de janeiro later são paulo,B1
25,Drug addiction,"Drug addiction is a brain disorder involving a compulsive use of drugs in spite of its detrimental consequences. Biologically, although drug use leads to unfavorable results, the drug addict's brain functions to reward drug-taking. In addition to that, at the psychological level, the drug addict becomes enslaved and loses control over the addictive behavior.
The symptoms of drug addiction include the following:
Biologically, the normal function and chemistry of our brain encourage the individual to repeat behaviors that are enjoyable such as sleeping, eating, and sex. Sadly, although the repetition of pleasurable activities may ensure our species survival, it may also have detrimental consequences by making the individual defenseless against addiction. Psychologically, drug addicts cling to the addictive behavior despite its harmful effects because they anticipate some benefit from it. Examples of these benefits include relief from stress or boredom and escaping from a difficult situation.
What is meant by a drug? A drug is any substance that causes a change in an organism's physiology or psychology when consumed. They can be legal or illegal. Examples of these addictive substances include:
To the question 'can addiction be treated?' the answer is 'yes'. But like all chronicle diseases, quitting a drug for a few weeks does not mean that the drug addict has been cured. Drug addicts need a long time to completely recover and regain control of their lives.
The first step in drug addiction treatment is detoxification. Medication can help drug addicts in the treatment process by alleviating the withdrawal symptoms. It should be noted though that the detoxification step is not enough. The patient must receive further treatment, otherwise, the patient will probably relapse.
To prevent relapse, patients are given medications that help them have healthier brain function and reduce cravings. In addition to that, behavioral therapies help drug addicts change their perspective and behaviors towards drug use and replace harmful drug habits with new healthy life skills.",drug addict brain disord involv compuls use drug spite detriment consequ biolog although drug use lead unfavor result drug addict brain function reward addit psycholog level drug addict becom enslav lose control addict behavior symptom drug addict includ follow biolog normal function chemistri brain encourag individu repeat behavior enjoy sleep eat sex sadli although repetit pleasur activ may ensur speci surviv may also detriment consequ make individu defenseless addict psycholog drug addict cling addict behavior despit harm effect anticip benefit exampl benefit includ relief stress boredom escap difficult situat meant drug drug substanc caus chang organ physiolog psycholog consum legal illeg exampl addict substanc includ question addict treat answer like chronicl diseas quit drug week mean drug addict cure drug addict need long time complet recov regain control live first step drug addict treatment detoxif medic help drug addict treatment process allevi withdraw symptom note though detoxif step enough patient must receiv treatment otherwis patient probabl relaps prevent relaps patient given medic help healthier brain function reduc crave addit behavior therapi help drug addict chang perspect behavior toward drug use replac harm drug habit new healthi life skill,C1
26,Tips for new school year start,"The summer holiday is over. It is time to think of the new school year. And while some are eager to know their new teacher and meet their friends to tell them about all their summer adventures, others are more worried about the new year. Here are some tips for a smooth school year start that will help you beat the stress and organize your study environment.
During holidays, children have often been allowed to sleep late and eat a little of what they wanted at any time. The first thing to do is to help yourself make a smooth start and not to wait until the last day to find a healthy lifestyle. You should get used to having regular and reasonable hours of sleep and to eating healthy food. This of course needs several days of ""rehabilitation"". The ideal thing is to start reconnecting with a healthy lifestyle one week to ten days before school starts.
Buy all the resources available for your grade. This will help you tremendously do your homework rightly. The resources may include a good dictionary, an encyclopedia, educational software...
A few days before school starts, do a tidy-up of the desk and the shelves. Sort and throw away the relics of the past year. Donate your old books, pens, and school things if they are still usable. Clean up your desk. Make it a comfortable place to do your homework. Your workplace should be a quiet well-lit corner where it feels good.
If you change your school, you need to learn how to find your way from your home to the new school. Start building new relationships in your new school environment. It will be easy for you to make new friends if you are willing to. Your new friends will certainly show you the places around the school. Your new teachers will also be happy to introduce you to your classmates.
If you feel anxious about the new school year, it is very important to talk to your parents about your fears. They will surely find a way to help you get over your fears and gain confidence. They will certainly show you that they believe in your abilities and will be willing to help you with your first pieces of homework if need be. It is also essential that you develop self-confidence and believe in your own potential.
If you are overly anxious about performance, work through your negative beliefs, especially the beliefs about the implications of school failure. Challenge your negative thoughts that your worth as a person or future prospects hinges entirely on your grades. Good performance will be achieved only when you beat your fears and discover your worth.
Enjoy setting goals for yourself, so you can transcend your weaknesses and reach your full potential. Your study goals must be realistic and achievable. For example, start with small steps to reach higher targets.
Achieving some goals will certainly motivate you to reach more challenging targets. Another motivating factor would be to understand that you work primarily for yourself and your future career. Apart from the external rewards that your parents may promise you, you must understand that studying well is your chance for self-development.",summer holiday time think new school year eager know new teacher meet friend tell summer adventur other worri new year tip smooth school year start help beat stress organ studi environ holiday child often allow sleep late eat littl want time first thing help make smooth start wait last day find healthi lifestyl get use regular reason hour sleep eat healthi food cours need sever day rehabilit ideal thing start reconnect healthi lifestyl one week ten day school start buy resourc avail grade help tremend homework rightli resourc may includ good dictionari encyclopedia educ softwar day school start desk shelv sort throw away relic past year donat old book pen school thing still usabl clean desk make comfort place homework workplac quiet corner feel good chang school need learn find way home new school start build new relationship new school environ easi make new friend will new friend certainli show place around school new teacher also happi introduc classmat feel anxiou new school year import talk parent fear sure find way help get fear gain confid certainli show believ abil will help first piec homework need also essenti develop believ potenti overli anxiou perform work neg belief especi belief implic school failur challeng neg thought worth person futur prospect hing entir grade good perform achiev beat fear discov worth enjoy set goal transcend weak reach full potenti studi goal must realist achiev exampl start small step reach higher target achiev goal certainli motiv reach challeng target anoth motiv factor would understand work primarili futur career apart extern reward parent may promis must understand studi well chanc,B2
27,Father's day,"Father's Day was created to complement Mother's Day. Like Mother's Day which honors mothers and motherhood, Father's Day celebrates fatherhood and paternal bonds; it highlights the influence of fathers in society. Many countries celebrate it on the third Sunday of June, but it is also celebrated widely on other days.
Historically, Sonora Smart Dodd was the woman behind the celebration of male parenting. Her father, the Civil War veteran William Jackson Smart, was a single parent who raised his six children there. After hearing a sermon about Jarvis' Mother's Day in 1909, she told her pastor that fathers should have a similar holiday honoring them. Although she initially suggested June 5, her father's birthday, the pastors did not have enough time to prepare their sermons, and the celebration was deferred to the third Sunday of June. The first celebration was in Spokane, Washington at the YMCA (Young Men's Christian Association) on June 19, 1910.
In recognition of what fathers do for their families, on this day people may have a party celebrating male parenting or simply make a phone call or send a greeting card. Besides, schools help children prepare handmade gifts for their fathers many days before the celebration.",father day creat complement mother day like mother day honor mother motherhood father day celebr fatherhood patern bond highlight influenc father societi mani countri celebr third sunday june also celebr wide day histor sonora smart dodd woman behind celebr male parent father civil war veteran william jackson smart singl parent rais six child hear sermon jarvi mother day told pastor father similar holiday honor although initi suggest june father birthday pastor enough time prepar sermon celebr defer third sunday june first celebr spokan washington ymca young men christian associ june recognit father famili day peopl may parti celebr male parent simpli make phone call send greet card besid school help child prepar handmad gift father mani day celebr,B1

Biography aldous huxley,""Aldous Huxley was an English writer and philosopher. He wrote about fifty books, both fiction and non-fiction works. He also wrote essays, narratives, and poems.
Aldous was born on 26 July 1894 into the famous Huxley family, whose members are known for excelling in science, medicine, arts, and literature. He graduated from Balliol College, Oxford with an undergraduate degree in English literature. Early in his career, he published short stories and poetry and edited the literary magazine Oxford Poetry, before going on to publish travel writing, satire, and screenplays. He spent the latter part of his life in the United States, living in Los Angeles from 1937 until his death. By the end of his life, Huxley was widely recognized for being one of the most prominent intellectuals of his time. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature seven times and was elected Companion of Literature by the Royal Society of Literature in 1962.
Huxley was a humanist and pacifist. He grew interested in philosophical mysticism and universalism, addressing these subjects with works such as The Perennial Philosophy (1945)—which illustrates commonalities between Western and Eastern mysticism. As far as his literary works, his most famous novel Brave New World (1932) has been ranked at number 5 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century by the Modern Library in 1999.
Aldous Huxley died of Laryngeal cancer on November 22, 1963. Media coverage of Huxley's death was overshadowed by the assassination of American President John F. Kennedy on the same day, less than seven hours before Huxley's death.""
Pearl harbor attack,""The attack on Pearl Harbor or the Battle of Pearl Harbor, the Hawaii Operation was a surprise military strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii Territory, on the morning of December 7, 1941. The attack led to the United States' entry into World War II. The Japanese attack was a preventive action to keep the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions they planned in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States. The attack started at 7:48 and caused serious casualties and widespread damage in the base.
The undeclared assault came as a profound shock to the American people and led directly to the American entry into World War II in both the Pacific and European theaters. The following day, December 8, the United States declared war on Japan. Domestic support for non-interventionism, which had been fading since the Fall of France in 1940, disappeared. Clandestine support of the United Kingdom was replaced by an active alliance. Subsequent operations by the U.S. prompted Germany and Italy to declare war on the U.S. on December 11, which was reciprocated by the U.S. the same day.
The day after the attack, Roosevelt delivered his famous Infamy Speech to a Joint Session of Congress, calling for a formal declaration of war on the Empire of Japan. Congress obliged his request less than an hour later. Roosevelt described the previous day as """"a date which will live in infamy"""". The speech is also commonly referred to as the """"Pearl Harbor Speech."""" The speech was just a little over seven minutes long. Secretary of State Cordell Hull had recommended that the President devote more time to a fuller exposition of Japanese-American relations and the lengthy but unsuccessful effort to find a peaceful solution. However, Roosevelt kept the speech short in the belief that it would have a more dramatic effect.""
Benefits of fasting,""Fasting is part and parcel of the practices of many religions including, Islam, Judaism and Christianity. Today many are trying to dig up the benefits of fasting. Some people fast for spiritual reasons while others fast as a way to physically discipline the body. Whatever reasons one might come up with, it has been scientifically proved that fasting has tremendous health benefits.
First, fasting is said to play an important role in the detoxification of the body. Detoxification is a normal body process of eliminating or neutralizing toxins through the colon, liver, kidneys, lungs, lymph glands, and skin. This process starts when fasting. Food no longer enters the body and the latter turns to fat reserves for energy. These fat reserves were created when excess glucose and carbohydrates were not used for energy or growth, not excreted, and therefore converted into fat. When the fat reserves are used for energy during a fast, it releases the chemicals from the fatty acids into the system which are then eliminated through the body organs, leading to the cleansing of the whole body.
An other known benefit of fasting is the healing process that is obvious in the body during a fast. When fasting energy is diverted away from the digestive system due to its lack of use and towards the metabolism and immune system. The healing process during a fast is made easy by the body's search for energy sources. Abnormal growths within the body, tumors and the like, do not have the full support of the body's supplies and therefore are more susceptible to disappear.
Fasting also leads to a feeling of rejuvenation and extended life expectancy. This might be due to the detoxification effect of fasting. A study was performed on earthworms that showed the extension of life thanks to fasting. The experiment was performed in the 1930s by isolating one worm and putting it on a cycle of fasting and feeding. The isolated worm outlived the other worms by 19 generations, while still maintaining its freshness and youthful physiological characteristics.""
Dolphins sleep,""Since Dolphins are like human being in so many ways. For example, dolphins have a special respiratory just like humans. The only difference is that dolphins are able to stay underwater for a long time without breathing oxygen. But how do dolphins manage to sleep without drowning?
Generally, dolphins sleep with only one brain hemisphere in slow-wave sleep at a time, thus maintaining enough consciousness to breathe and to watch for possible predators and other threats. Earlier sleep stages can occur simultaneously in both hemispheres. In captivity, dolphins seemingly enter a fully asleep state where both eyes are closed and there is no response to mild external stimuli. In this case, respiration is automatic; a tail kick reflex keeps the blowhole above the water if necessary. Anesthetized dolphins initially show a tail kick reflex. Though a similar state has been observed with wild sperm whales, it is not known if dolphins in the wild reach this state. The Indus river dolphin has a sleep method that is different from that of other dolphin species. Living in water with strong currents and potentially dangerous floating debris, it must swim continuously to avoid injury. As a result, this species sleeps in very short bursts which last between 4 and 60 seconds.""
Organizations amnesty international,""Amnesty International is a non-governmental organization (NGO) which focuses on human rights. It is also known as Amnesty and AI and has over 3 million members and supporters around the world. Amnesty International is financed largely by fees and donations from its worldwide membership. It does not accept donations from governments or governmental organizations. It is largely made up of voluntary members, but retains a small number of paid professionals. The objective of the organization is:
""""to conduct research and generate action to prevent and end grave abuses of human rights, and to demand justice for those whose rights have been violated.""""
Amnesty International was founded in London in 1961, following the publication of the article """"The Forgotten Prisoners"""" in The Observer 28 May 1961, by the lawyer Peter Benenson. In this article, Benenson cites the Universal Declaration of Human Rights articles 18 and 19, announced a campaign on """"Appeal for Amnesty, 1961"""" and called for """"common action"""". Amnesty draws attention to human rights abuses and campaigns for compliance with international laws and standards. It works to mobilize public opinion to put pressure on governments that let abuse take place. The organization was awarded the 1977 Nobel Peace Prize for its """"campaign against torture"""", and the United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights in 1978.""
The old man and the sea,""The Old Man and the Sea is a novel was the last major work of fiction to be written by Ernest Hemingway and published in his lifetime. It is considered to be one of his most famous works and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1953 and was cited by the Nobel Committee as contributing to the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Hemingway in 1954.
The Old Man and the Sea is the story of a battle between an old, experienced Cuban fisherman and a large marlin. The novel opens with the explanation that the fisherman, who is named Santiago, has gone 84 days without catching a fish. In fact, he is so unlucky that his young apprentice, Manolin, has been forbidden by his parents to sail with the old man and been ordered to fish with more successful fishermen. Still dedicated to the old man, however, the boy visits Santiago's shack each night. On the eighty-fifth day, Santiago sets out alone, taking his skiff far onto the Gulf Stream. He sets his lines and, by noon of the first day, a big fish that he is sure is a marlin takes his bait. After a long struggle with the fish Santiago manages to strap the marlin to the side of his skiff and heads home, thinking about the high price the fish will bring him at the market and how many people he will feed. While Santiago sails back back to the shore, sharks are attracted to the trail of blood left by the marlin in the water. Despite his efforts to ward off the sharks, they have almost devoured the marlin's entire carcass, leaving a skeleton consisting mostly of its backbone, its tail and its head. Once home, he slumps onto his bed and falls into a deep sleep. The next day, a group of fishermen gather around the boat where the fish's skeleton is still attached. Manolin, worried during the old man's endeavor, cries upon finding him safe asleep. The boy brings him newspapers and coffee. When the old man wakes, they promise to fish together once again. Upon his return to sleep, Santiago dreams of his youth—of lions on an African beach. The old man feels very unwell and also coughs up blood a few times towards the end of the story. He doesn't tell the boy.
The novel has received so much praise and is considered to be one of the best novels in American literature. Santiago fights the creatures of the sea and some readers think that the story is about man’s battle against the natural world. However, the novel can be viewed as the story of man’s place in relation to nature. In the story, Santiago and the marlin show similar qualities of pride, honor, and bravery, and both are subject to the same eternal natural law - they must kill or be killed. Santiago himself says:
“man is not made for defeat . . . [a] man can be destroyed but not defeated.”""
What is friendship in simple words,""Develop your reading skills. Read the following text about meditation and do the comprehension questions
Friendship is defined as a bond of affection between two people. People are referred to as best friends if the friendship is really strong. this relationship is characterized by positive interpersonal qualities such as kindness, generosity, loyalty, and honesty. True friends choose to be with one another, enjoy time spent together, and can engage in a positive and supportive role to one another.
As reciprocity, mutual respect, and affection rise, so does the depth of friendship. Consequently, different levels of friendship emerge according to the depth of the relationship.
It's easy to classify acquaintances. They're the people you meet frequently at casual places but don't truly know each other. These are people we know well enough to strike up a conversation with from time to time, but not people we'd ask to a dinner party or contact for help.
You're more inclined to seek help or support from a close buddy. There is not only a high level of trust amongst close friends but also a great deal of genuine love and affection. Even if you disagree with a close friend's decisions, you would protect his or her freedom to make them.
Although best friends are quite rare, they are people whom we need in our lives. Your best friend understands you without much explanation and is always there for you. Your relationship with your best friend is not dependent on the time you spend together. You may not meet your best friends for a long time. But once you get in touch with them, you feel as if nothing has changed in your friendship. These connections are distinct in their ability to adapt to the environment and endure despite the vagaries of life.
Virtual friendship is a relatively new type of friendship. It refers to friendship that takes place on the internet and is unlikely to be connected to real-life interaction. It is contrasted with the traditional friendships that we have listed above. The latter is a form of relationship that requires a lot of face-to-face connection.
This type of friendship developed as a result of advances in technology. The internet, especially social media, played an undeniable role in connecting people worldwide.
According to Doctor Suzanne Degges-White, there are 13 essential traits of good friends:
As Doctor Suzanne Degges-White says, it is probably difficult to find friends endowed with all these thirteen qualities. But as a friend, you have to try to examine your personal habits to discover if you need to improve your friendship.""
Ancient egypt civilization,""Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeastern Africa, which followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150Â BC with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Menes. The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable Kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods:
Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power in the New Kingdom, during the Ramesside period, where it rivaled the Hittite Empire, Assyrian Empire, and Mitanni Empire
The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the Nile River valley for agriculture. The predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops, which supported a more dense population, and social development and culture. The development of ancient Egypt was also due to a very advanced system of administration. The contributions of ancient Egypt include:
The ancient Egyptians also had a military intended to defeat foreign enemies and assert Egyptian dominance.
Motivating and organizing the administrative activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes, religious leaders, and administrators under the control of a pharaoh, who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of religious beliefs. This system of administration resulted in outstanding achievements. These include:
Egypt left a lasting legacy. Its art and architecture were widely copied, and its antiquities carried off to far corners of the world. Its monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of travelers and writers for centuries. A new-found respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period by Europeans and Egyptians led to the scientific investigation of Egyptian civilization and a greater appreciation of its cultural legacy.
After reaching the pinnacle of its power in the New Kingdom, during the Ramesside period, ancient Egypt entered a period of slow decline. Egypt was invaded or conquered by a succession of foreign powers, such as the Canaanites/Hyksos, Libyans, the Nubians, the Assyrians, Babylonians, the Achaemenid Persians, and the Macedonians in the Third Intermediate Period and the Late Period of Egypt. In the aftermath of Alexander the Great's death, one of his generals, Ptolemy Soter, established himself as the new ruler of Egypt. This Greek Ptolemaic Kingdom ruled Egypt until 30Â BC, when, under Cleopatra, it fell to the Roman Empire and became a Roman province.""
English educational system,""Education is a devolved matter in the UK, with separate systems overseen by separate governments. England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, with certain exceptions, follow the National Curriculum of the United Kingdom. Scotland, on the other hand, has its own set of educational standards.
The Department for Education in the United Kingdom is in charge of education in England. Local government officials are in charge of putting public education and state-funded schools policies into action on a local level.
The English educational system is divided into primary, secondary, and higher education. Children are required to start school at the age of five. Compulsory education lasts until the age of sixteen. Most pupils transfer from primary to secondary education at the age of eleven.
Students may then continue their secondary studies for a further two years (sixth form), leading most typically to an A level qualification, although other qualifications and courses exist, including Business and Technology Education Council (BTEC) qualifications and the International Baccalaureate.
Higher education typically begins with a 3-year Bachelor's Degree. Postgraduate degrees include Master's Degrees, either taught or by research, and Doctor of Philosophy, a research degree that usually takes at least 3 years.""
Winter olympic games,""The Winter Olympic Games is a major international sporting event that occurs once every four years. The first Winter Olympics, the 1924 Winter Olympics, was held in Chamonix, France. The original sports were alpine and cross-country skiing, figure skating, ice hockey, Nordic combined, ski jumping and speed skating.

The Games were held every four years from 1924 until 1936, after which they were interrupted by World War II. The Olympics resumed in 1948 and was again held every four years. Until 1992, the Winter and Summer Olympic Games were held in the same years, but in accordance with a 1986 decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to place the Summer and Winter Games on separate four-year cycles in alternating even-numbered years, the next Winter Olympics after 1992 was in 1994.
The Winter Olympics has been hosted on three continents by eleven different countries, but never in a country in the southern hemisphere.""
Thomas edison,""Thomas Alva Edison was an American inventor and businessman. He was born on February 11, 1847. His mother taught him at home. Much of his education came from reading R.G. Parker's School of Natural Philosophy and The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art. Edison developed hearing problems at an early age. The cause of his deafness has been attributed to a bout of scarlet fever during childhood and recurring untreated middle-ear infections.
Edison developed many skills when he was young. He sold candy and newspapers on trains running from Port Huron to Detroit and sold vegetables to supplement his income. He also studied qualitative analysis and conducted chemical experiments on the train until an accident prohibited further work of the kind. Later, Edison obtained the exclusive right to sell newspapers on the road. This began Edison's long streak of entrepreneurial ventures, as he discovered his talents as a businessman. These talents eventually led him to found 14 companies, including General Electric, which is still one of the largest publicly traded companies in the world.
He developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and the long-lasting, practical electric light bulb. Dubbed """"The Wizard of Menlo Park"""", he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large-scale teamwork to the process of invention, and because of that, he is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory.
Edison died of complications of diabetes on October 18, 1931, in his home, """"Glenmont"""" in Llewellyn Park in West Orange, New Jersey, which he had purchased in 1886 as a wedding gift for Mina, his second wife. He is buried behind the home.""
Mary shelley biography,""Mary Shelley was an English novelist, short story writer, dramatist, essayist, biographer, and travel write. She was born on August thirtieth, 1797, and is best known for her Gothic novel Frankenstein: or, The Modern Prometheus (1818). She also edited and promoted the works of her husband, the Romantic poet and philosopher Percy Bysshe Shelley. Her father was the political philosopher William Godwin, and her mother was the philosopher and feminist Mary Wollstonecraft.
After their mother's death, Mary and her older half-sister, Fanny Imlay, were reared by their father. When Mary was four, Godwin married his neighbour, Mary Jane Clairmont. Godwin provided his daughter with a rich, if informal, education, encouraging her to adhere to his liberal political theories. In 1814, Mary Godwin began a romantic relationship with one of her father’s political followers, the married Percy Bysshe Shelley. Together with Mary's stepsister, Claire Clairmont, they left for France and travelled through Europe. When they returned to England, Mary was pregnant with Percy's child. Over the next two years, she and Percy faced ostracism, constant debt, and the death of their prematurely born daughter. They married in late 1816 after the suicide of Percy Shelley's first wife, Harriet.
In 1816, the couple famously spent a summer with Lord Byron, John William Polidori, and Claire Clairmont near Geneva, Switzerland, where Mary conceived the idea for her novel Frankenstein. The family left Britain in 1818 for Italy, where their second and third children died before Mary Shelley gave birth to her last and only surviving child, Percy Florence Shelley. In 1822, her husband drowned when his sailing boat sank during a storm near Viareggio. A year later, Mary Shelley returned to England and from then on devoted herself to the upbringing of her son and a career as a professional author. The last decade of her life was dogged by illness, probably caused by the brain tumor that was to kill her at the age of 53 on February first, 1851.
Until the 1970s, Mary Shelley was known mainly for her efforts to publish her husband's works and for her novel Frankenstein, which remains widely read and has inspired many theatrical and film adaptations. Recently scholars have shown increasing interest in her other literary output, particularly in her novels, which include the historical novels Valperga (1823) and Perkin Warbeck (1830), the apocalyptic novel The Last Man (1826), and her final two novels, Lodore (1835) and Falkner (1837).""
Cloud computing,""Cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive. It involves computing over a network, where a program or application may run on many connected computers at the same time.
For some, cloud computing is a metaphor for the Internet. It typically uses connected hardware machines called servers. Individual users can use the server's processing power to run an application, store data, or perform any other computing task. Thus, instead of using a personal computer every-time to run the application, the individual can now run the application from anywhere in the world.
For businesses, cloud computing is an ideal way to reduce expenses. For example, companies may buy services in the cloud. That is to say, instead of installing applications on every single computer in the company, cloud computing would allow workers to log into a Web-based service (a cloud) which hosts all the programs individual users would need for their job. Everything would run on remote machines and local computers task would rely just on connecting to those machines.
While cloud computing, could change the entire computer industry, there are still some concerns about the security of the data stored on the remote machines. It is true that it promises to offload many tasks. However, this technology raises a fundamental question. Is it safe to store one's data on someone else's computer? The cloud service provider needs to establish clear and relevant policies that describe how the data of each cloud user will be accessed and used. Cloud service users should also be able to encrypt data that is processed or stored within the cloud to prevent unauthorized access.""
Rap music,""Rap music is a style of popular music, developed by disc jockeys and urban blacks in the late 1970s. It is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates """"rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular"""", which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually over a backbeat or musical accompaniment.
The components of rap include:
Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that rap is usually performed in time to an instrumental track. Rap is often associated with and is a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon predate hip-hop culture.
Rap is usually delivered over a beat, typically provided by a DJ (abbreviation of Disc Jockey), turntablist, Beatboxer, or performed A capella without accompaniment. Stylistically, rap occupies a gray area between speech, prose, poetry, and singing.
The word 'rap' predates the musical form. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary gives a date of 1541 for the first recorded use of the word 'rap 'with the meaning """"to utter (esp. an oath) sharply, vigorously, or suddenly."""" The word is now used to describe quick speech or repartee. It had been used in British English since the 16th century. It was part of the African American dialect of English in the 1960s meaning """"to converse"""", and very soon after that in its present usage as a term denoting the musical style. Today, the term rap is so closely associated with hip-hop music that many writers use the terms interchangeably.
The earliest precursor to the modern rap is the West African griot (i.e. a West African historian, storyteller, praise singer, poet, or musician.) tradition, in which """"oral historians"""", or """"praise-singers"""", would disseminate oral traditions and genealogies, or use their formidable rhetorical techniques for gossip or to """"praise or critique individuals."""" Griot traditions connect to rap along a lineage of Black verbal reverence that goes back to ancient Egyptian practices, through James Brown interacting with the crowd and the band between songs, to Muhammad Ali's quick-witted verbal taunts and the palpitating poems of the Last Poets. Therefore, rap lyrics and music are part of the """"Black rhetorical continuum"""", and aim to reuse elements of past traditions while expanding upon them through creative use of language and rhetorical styles and strategies. The person credited with originating the style of delivering rhymes over extensive music, that would become known as rap, was Anthony Holloway, better known as DJ Hollywood, from Harlem, New York.
Rap music has often been subject to criticism, especially for the issues rappers tackle in their songs. Other than some social issues, the main subject is violence and drugs.""
Youth,""Juvenile delinquency refers to antisocial or illegal behavior by children or adolescents and is considered a serious problem all over the world. It is caused by social, economic and cultural factors. This juvenile criminality is apparent in marginal sectors of urban areas where children are exposed to violence in their immediate social environment, either as observers or as victims. Because delinquents basic education, if they have any, is poor they have been marginalized from society and destitute of any dignity or self esteem. Although most legal systems prescribe specific procedures for dealing with young criminals, such as juvenile detention centers and suppression, approaches to prevent youth from becoming delinquent should also include measures to instill equality and justice, fight poverty and create an atmosphere of hope and peace among youth. These preventive policies should be given priorities over any coercive measures.
Socioeconomic opportunities and administrative services should be provided in rural areas to discourage young people from migrating to urban areas. Similarly, youth from poor urban settings should benefit from plans that focus on education, employment and access to leisure programs , especially during long school holidays. Young people who drop out of school or come from broken families should have access to specific social programs that help them become responsible adults.
Information campaigns should be planned to sensitize youth to be aware of the detrimental effects of violence on the family, community and society, to teach them how to communicate without violence. Focus on the importance of family should become a priority because it is the primary institution of socialization of youth and continues to play an important role in the prevention of juvenile delinquency and underage crime.""
World war 1,""On June 1914, Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary. This set off a diplomatic crisis when Austria-Hungary delivered an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia, a series of ten demands that were made intentionally unacceptable, in an effort to provoke a war with Serbia. International alliances formed and within weeks, the major powers were at war.
The conflict soon spread around the world. Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire formed the so-called Central Powers against Great Britain, France, Russia, Italy and Japan formed the Allied Powers. Later, the United States joined the Allies in 1917 .
More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over 9 million combatants and 7 million civilians died as a result of this global war, a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication. Armies used modern weaponry such as machine guns, tanks and chemical weapons. The tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare also added to the unprecedented number of victims. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.
By the end of the war on November 11th, 1918, the German Empire, Russian Empire, Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire ceased to exist. National borders were redrawn, with several independent nations restored or created, and Germany's colonies were parceled out among the winners. During the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, the Big Four (Britain, France, the United States and Italy) imposed their terms in a series of treaties. The League of Nations was formed with the aim of preventing any repetition of such a conflict. This effort failed, and economic depression, renewed European nationalism, weakened member states, and the German feeling of humiliation contributed to the rise of Nazism. These conditions eventually contributed to World War II.""
Viking series,""Develop your reading skills. Read the following text about the Vikings Series!
VikingsÂ is a historical drama television series created and written by Michael Hirst for theÂ HistoryÂ channel. It was filmed in Ireland and is inspired by the sagas of VikingÂ Ragnar Lothbrok, one of the best-known legendary Norse heroes and notorious as the scourge of England and France.
The show portrays Ragnar as a farmer who rises to fame by successful raids into England and eventually becomes a Scandinavian King, with the support of his family and fellow warriors. In the later seasons, the series follows the fortunes of his sons and their adventures in England, Scandinavia and the Mediterranean.
The series is inspired by the tales of the Norsemen of early medieval Scandinavia, as notably laid down in the 13th-century sagasÂ Ragnars saga LoÃ°brÃ³karÂ andÂ Ragnarssona Ã¾Ã¡ttr, as well as in Saxo Grammaticus's 12th-century workÂ Gesta Danorum. It is worthwhile mentioning that Norse legendary sagas were partially fictional tales based in the Norse oral tradition, written down about 200 to 400 years after the events they describe. Further inspiration is taken from historical sources of the period, such as records of the Viking raid on Lindisfarne depicted in the second episode, or Ahmad ibn Fadlan's 10th-century account of the Varangians. The series begins at the start of the Viking Age, marked by the Lindisfarne raid in 793.
The cast includes, among others, Travis Fimmel as Ragnar Lothbrok (seasons 1â€“4), Katheryn Winnick as Lagertha, Clive Standen as Rollo (seasons 1â€“4; recurring season 5), Jessalyn Gilsig as Siggy (seasons 1â€“3), Gustaf SkarsgÃ¥rd as Floki.
Although the series was criticized for a lack of historical accuracy in some scenes, it received favorable reviews. According to Nielsen, the series premiere drew six million viewers in the US, topping all broadcast networks among viewers aged 18 to 49. It also premiered on March 3, 2013, in Canada and the United States.""
Wall of china,""The Great Wall of China, one of the greatest wonders of the world, was first built between 220–206 BC. In fact, it began as independent walls for different states when it was first built, and did not become the """"Great"""" wall until the Qin Dynasty. Emperor Qin Shihuang succeeded in his effort to have the walls joined together to serve as fortification to protect the northern borders of the Chinese Empire from invasion. Afterwards it was rebuilt and maintained over the years, between the 5th century BC and the 16th century.
One of the myths associated with the Great Wall of China is that it is the only man-made structure that can be seen from the moon with the naked eye. The legend originated in Richard Halliburton's 1938 book Second Book of Marvels. However, This myth is simply not true. Richard Halliburton's claim was contradicted by astronauts Neil Armstrongby and Yang Liwei. A more plausible assumption would be to say that the Great Wall can be visible from a low orbit of the earth which is not unique in this regard as many other artificial constructions can be seen from that height.""
Atlantis plato story,""Was Atlantis real? The mythical island of Atlantis has often been depicted in creative works such as films, books and paintings, but the origin of the story come from Timaeus, a Socratic dialogue, written in about 360 B.C. by Plato.
The Timaeus begins with an introduction, followed by an account of the creations and structure of the universe and ancient civilizations. In the introduction, Socrates muses about the perfect society, described in Plato's Republic (c. 380 BC), and wonders if he and his guests might recollect a story which exemplifies such a society. Critias mentions an allegedly historical tale that would make the perfect example, and follows by describing Atlantis as is recorded in the Critias. In his account, ancient Athens seems to represent the """"perfect society"""" and Atlantis its opponent, representing the very antithesis of the """"perfect"""" traits described in the Republic.
Atlantis is described in Timaeus as follows :
For it is related in our records how once upon a time your State stayed the course of a mighty host, which, starting from a distant point in the Atlantic ocean, was insolently advancing to attack the whole of Europe, and Asia to boot. For the ocean there was at that time navigable; for in front of the mouth which you Greeks call, as you say, 'the pillars of Heracles,' there lay an island which was larger than Libya and Asia together; and it was possible for the travelers of that time to cross from it to the other islands, and from the islands to the whole of the continent over against them which encompasses that veritable ocean. For all that we have here, lying within the mouth of which we speak, is evidently a haven having a narrow entrance; but that yonder is a real ocean, and the land surrounding it may most rightly be called, in the fullest and truest sense, a continent. Now in this island of Atlantis there existed a confederation of kings, of great and marvelous power, which held sway over all the island, and over many other islands also and parts of the continent.
According to Critias, 9,000 years before his lifetime a war took place between those outside the Pillars of Hercules at the Strait of Gibraltar and those who dwelt within them. The Atlanteans had conquered the parts of Libya within the Pillars of Hercules as far as Egypt and the European continent as far as Tyrrhenia, and subjected its people to slavery. The Athenians led an alliance of resistors against the Atlantean empire, and as the alliance disintegrated, prevailed alone against the empire, liberating the occupied lands.
But at a later time there occurred portentous earthquakes and floods, and one grievous day and night befell them, when the whole body of your warriors was swallowed up by the earth, and the island of Atlantis in like manner was swallowed up by the sea and vanished; wherefore also the ocean at that spot has now become impassable and unsearchable, being blocked up by the shoal mud which the island created as it settled down""

Organizations fao,""The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations that leads international efforts to defeat hunger. It was established on 16 October 1945. In 1951, its headquarters were moved from Washington, D.C., United States, to Rome, Italy. Serving both developed and developing countries, FAO acts as a neutral forum where all nations meet as equals to negotiate agreements and debate policy. The organization's Regular Program budget is funded by its members, through contributions set at the FAO Conference.
FAO is also a source of knowledge and information, and helps developing countries and countries in transition modernize and improve agriculture, forestry and fisheries practices, ensuring good nutrition and food security for all. Its Latin motto, fiat panis, translates into English as """"let there be bread"""".""
Romeo and juliet summary,""This is a short summary of Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare. The play which is set in Verona is a story about a long feud between the Montague and Capulet families. This feud causes tragic results for the main characters in the play, Romeo and Juliet. The events contrast hatred and revenge with love and a secret marriage, forcing the young star-crossed lovers to grow up quickly and die tragically in despair.
Here is a short summary of the main events of Romeo and Juliet:
Romeo and Juliet fall in love at a party. But they come from families which hate each other. They are sure they will not be allowed to marry. Nevertheless, helped by Friar Laurence, they marry in secret instead. Unfortunately, before their wedding night Romeo kills Juliet's cousin in a duel, and in the morning he is forced to leave her. If he ever returns to the city, he will be put to death.
Juliet's parents told her she must marry Paris. Her parents do not know she is already married. She refuses in the beginning, but later agrees because she plans to fake her death and escape to be with Romeo forever; again with the help of Friar Laurence.
Frair Laurence designs the plan. He gives Juliet a sleeping potion. She appears to be dead and was put in a tomb. However, Romeo does not know about the plan, visits her grave, thinks she is dead, and kills himself. When Juliet finally wakes up, she discovers that Romeo is dead and then kills herself.""
Virginia woolf,""Virginia Woolf was an English author, feminist, essayist, publisher, and critic, considered as one of the foremost modernists of the twentieth century along with T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, James Joyce, and Gertrude Stein. Her parents were Sir Leslie Stephen (1832–1904), who was a notable historian, author, critic and mountaineer, and Julia Prinsep Duckworth (1846–1895), a renowned beauty. According to Woolf's memoirs, her most vivid childhood memories were not of London but of St. Ives in Cornwall, where the family spent every summer until 1895. This place inspired her to write one of her masterpieces, To the Lighthouse.
The sudden death of her mother in 1895, when Virginia was 13, and that of her half-sister Stella two years later, led to the first of Virginia's several nervous breakdowns. but it was the death of her father in 1904 provoked her most alarming collapse and she was briefly institutionalised. Some scholars have suggested that her mental instability was also due to the sexual abuse to which she and her sister Vanessa were subjected by their half-brothers George and Gerald Duckworth.
Woolf came to know the founders of the the Bloomsbury Group. She became an active member of this literary circle. Later, Virginia Stephen married writer Leonard Woolf on 10 August 1912. Despite his low material status (Woolf referring to Leonard during their engagement as a """"penniless Jew"""") the couple shared a close bond.
Virginia's most famous works include the novels Mrs Dalloway (1925), To the Lighthouse (1927) and Orlando (1928), and the book-length essay A Room of One's Own (1929), with its famous dictum, """"A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction."""" In some of her novels she moves away from the use of plot and structure to employ stream-of-consciousness to emphasise the psychological aspects of her characters.
After completing the manuscript of her last (posthumously published) novel, Between the Acts, Woolf fell into a depression similar to that which she had earlier experienced. On 28 March 1941, Woolf put on her overcoat, filled its pockets with stones, and walked into the River Ouse near her home and drowned herself. Woolf's body was not found until 18 April 1941. Her husband buried her cremated remains under an elm in the garden of Monk's House, their home in Rodmell, Sussex.
Her final writing were these words addressed to her husband:
""""I know that I am spoiling your life, that without me you could work. And you will I know. You see I can't even write this properly. I can't read. What I want to say is I owe all the happiness of my life to you. You have been entirely patient with me and incredibly good. I want to say that—everybody knows it. If anybody could have saved me it would have been you. Everything has gone from me but the certainty of your goodness. I can't go on spoiling your life any longer. I don't think two people could have been happier than we have been.""""""
Addiction definition types treatment,""Addiction can be defined as a brain disorder identified by compulsive engagement in rewarding stimuli despite unfavorable consequences. Two factors determine any type of addiction. These are the psychological and biological processes involved in the addictive behavior. The biological process is induced by repeated exposure to an addictive stimulus and is the core pathology that drives the development and maintenance of an addiction. At the psychological level, the cognitive control, and particularly inhibitory control over behavior, is impaired in addiction.
Two properties are involved in all addictive stimuli. They are reinforcing and intrinsically rewarding. Addictive stimuli are reinforcing because they increase the likelihood that a person will seek repeated exposure to them. They are also intrinsically rewarding since they are perceived as being inherently positive, desirable, and pleasurable. The pleasure felt by addiction leads to a particularly powerful increase of dopamine. The latter is a neurotransmitter that sends signals to nerve cells in the brain. Addictive behavior provides a shortcut to the brain's reward system by flooding the brain with dopamine. This mechanism increases the likelihood of craving for the object of addiction and losing complete control over its use.
As described by two groups of researchers, addiction causes an """"astoundingly high financial and human toll"""" on individuals and society as a whole through the direct adverse effects of drugs, associated healthcare costs, long-term complications, the functional consequences of altered neural plasticity in the brain, and the consequent loss of productivity. Classic hallmarks of addiction include impaired control over substances or behavior, preoccupation with substance or behavior, and continued use despite consequences. Habits and patterns associated with addiction are typically characterized by immediate gratification (short-term reward), coupled with delayed deleterious effects (long-term costs).
Examples of drug and behavioral addictions include alcoholism, amphetamine addiction, cocaine addiction, nicotine addiction, opiate addiction, food addiction, gambling addiction, computer addiction, and sexual addiction.
In order to be effective, all pharmacological or biologically (i.e. medication) based treatments for addiction need to be integrated into other established forms of addiction rehabilitation, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and individual and group psychotherapy. Research suggests that cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, and a community reinforcement approach were effective interventions with moderate effect sizes. Evidence also indicates that consistent aerobic exercise, especially endurance exercise such as marathon running, actually prevents the development of certain drug addictions""
Coffee history,""The history of coffee
The origin of coffee as a drink or a plant dates back to the middle the of the 15th century in the Sufi Muslim monasteries around Mocha in Yemen. It was in Arabia that coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed, in a similar way to how it is now prepared. By the 16th century, it had reached the rest of the Middle East, Persia, Turkey, and northern Africa.
The first coffee smuggled out of the Middle East was by Sufi Baba Budan from Yemen to India in 1670. Before then, all exported coffee was boiled or otherwise sterilized. Portraits of Baba Budan depict him as having smuggled seven coffee seeds by strapping them to his chest. The first plants grown from these smuggled seeds were planted in Mysore, in the state of Karnataka, India. Coffee then spread to Italy, and to the rest of Europe, to Indonesia, and to the Americas.
When coffee reached North America during the Colonial period, it was initially not as successful as it had been in Europe as alcoholic beverages remained more popular. During the Revolutionary War, the demand for coffee increased so much that dealers had to hoard their scarce supplies and raise prices dramatically.
Coffee was introduced to Brazil in 1727, although its cultivation did not gather momentum until independence in 1822. After this time massive tracts of rainforest were cleared for coffee plantations, first in the vicinity of Rio de Janeiro and later São Paulo.""",name text biographi aldou huxley aldou huxley english

29,Mickey mouse,"Mickey Mouse is a cartoon character who has become an icon for the Walt Disney Company. Mickey Mouse is short for Mitchell Mouse. It was created in 1928 by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks and voiced by Walt Disney.
The first appearance of Mickey Mouse was in Plane Crazy on May 15, 1928. But the Walt Disney Company celebrates Mickey Mouse birth as November 18, 1928 upon the release of Steamboat Willie, because it is the first Mickey Mouse Cartoon with sound. The anthropomorphic mouse has developed along the years. He first appeared in color in 1935. The first Technicolor Disney film was Flowers and Trees from 1932. He also evolved from being simply a character in animated cartoons and comic strips to become one of the most recognizable symbols in the world.
Mickey's popularity has grown around the world. This was due to his angelic nature. Mickey never does anything immoral. However, in 2009 the Walt Disney Company announced that they will begin to re-brand the Mickey Mouse character by moving away from his pleasant, cheerful image and reintroducing the more devious side of his personality, starting with the upcoming Epic Mickey, a Mickey Mouse video game. The Walt Disney company thus intends to show the mischievous side of Mickey's personality.",mickey mous cartoon charact becom icon walt disney compani mickey mous short mitchel mous creat walt disney ub iwerk voic walt disney first appear mickey mous plane crazi may walt disney compani celebr mickey mous birth novemb upon releas steamboat willi first mickey mous cartoon sound anthropomorph mous develop along year first appear color first technicolor disney film flower tree also evolv simpli charact anim cartoon comic strip becom one recogniz symbol world mickey popular grown around world due angel natur mickey never anyth immor howev walt disney compani announc begin mickey mous charact move away pleasant cheer imag reintroduc deviou side person start upcom epic mickey mickey mous video game walt disney compani thu intend show mischiev side mickey person,B1
30,Science,"Information Technology (IT) is the application of computers and internet to store, retrieve, transmit, and manipulate information, often in the context of a business or other enterprise. IT is considered a subset of information and communications technology (ICT) and has evolved according to the needs.

It is worthwhile noting that the term IT is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks, but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones. Several industries are associated with information technology, including computer hardware, software, electronics, semiconductors, internet, telecom equipment, engineering, healthcare, e-commerce, and computer services.
Thanks to the continuous development of computers, the original computing systems became minicomputers and later personal computers took the lead. Nowadays, mobile phones are dethroning the personal computer and computing is evolving faster to become disembodied more like a cloud, becoming accessible more easily whenever needed. Information technology has transformed people and companies and has allowed digital technology to influence society and economy alike. It has, in this sense, shaped societies and adapted itself to people's needs.
If you want a brief history of Information Technology, here is one. Humans were the first ""computers"". Then, machines were invented to carry out the computational tasks. Now these machines have given way to new form of information technology. Information has become disembodied accessible from anywhere through cloud technology. Recent advances in IT is the consequence of the development in computing systems.
Humans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, and communicating information since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000 BC, but the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review; authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler commented that ""the new technology does not yet have a single established name. We shall call it information technology (IT)."" Their definition consists of three categories: techniques for processing, the application of statistical and mathematical methods to decision-making, and the simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs.",inform technolog applic comput internet store retriev transmit manipul inform often context busi enterpris consid subset inform commun technolog ict evolv accord need worthwhil note term commonli use synonym comput comput network also encompass inform distribut technolog televis telephon sever industri associ inform technolog includ comput hardwar softwar electron semiconductor internet telecom equip engin healthcar comput servic thank continu develop comput origin comput system becam minicomput later person comput took lead nowaday mobil phone dethron person comput comput evolv faster becom disembodi like cloud becom access easili whenev need inform technolog transform peopl compani allow digit technolog influenc societi economi alik sen shape societi adapt peopl need want brief histori inform technolog one human first comput machin invent carri comput task machin given way new form inform technolog inform becom disembodi access anywher cloud technolog recent advanc consequ develop comput system human store retriev manipul commun inform sinc sumerian mesopotamia develop write bc term inform technolog modern sen first appear articl publish harvard busi review author harold leavitt thoma whisler comment new technolog yet singl establish name shall call inform technolog definit consist three categori techniqu process applic statist mathemat method simul think comput program,B2
31,Coffee,"Coffee is a popular brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans. Coffee plants are cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, India and Africa. Once ripe, coffee beans are picked, processed, and dried.
Green (unroasted) coffee beans are one of the most traded agricultural commodities in the world. Once traded, the beans are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor, before being ground and brewed to create coffee. The two most commonly grown coffee beans are the highly regarded arabica, and the less sophisticated but stronger and more hardy robusta.
Coffee is one of the most popular drinks in the world. It is slightly acidic and can have a stimulating effect on humans because of its caffeine content. It can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways. The effect of coffee on human health has been a subject of many studies; however, results have varied in terms of coffee's relative benefit. The majority of recent research suggests that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial in healthy adults.
Coffee cultivation first took place in Southern Arabia. The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking appears in the middle of the 15th century in the Sufi shrines of Yemen. In the Horn of Africa and Yemen, coffee was used in local religious ceremonies. As these ceremonies conflicted with the beliefs of the Christian church, the Ethiopian Church banned the secular consumption of coffee until the reign of Emperor Menelik II. The beverage was also banned in Ottoman Turkey during the 17th century for political reasons, and was associated with rebellious political activities in Europe.
Coffee is a major export commodity: it was the top agricultural export for twelve countries in 2004, the world's seventh-largest legal agricultural export by value in 2005, and ""the second most valuable commodity exported by developing countries,"" from 1970 to 2000. Further, green (unroasted) coffee is one of the most traded agricultural commodities in the world. Some controversy is associated with coffee cultivation and its impact on the environment. Consequently, organic coffee is an expanding market.

32,Easter bunny,"The Easter Bunny (also called Easter Hare or Spring Bunny) is a character who brings baskets filled with colored eggs, candy, and sometimes also toys to the homes of children on the night before Easter. It is depicted as a rabbit sometimes with clothes. When Easter Bunny brings the gifts, it will either put the baskets in a designated place or hide them somewhere in the house or garden for the children to find when they wake up in the morning.
Like Santa Claus, Easter Bunny brings gifts to children on the night before the holiday. Easter Bunny and the eggs symbolize fertility. Since birds lay eggs and rabbits and hares give birth to large litters in the early spring, these became symbols of the rising fertility of the earth and were adopted by early Christians as a symbol of the resurrection of Jesus.",easter bunni also call easter hare spring bunni charact bring basket fill color egg candi sometim also toy home child night easter depict rabbit sometim cloth easter bunni bring gift either put basket design place hide somewher hous garden child find wake morn like santa clau easter bunni bring gift child night holiday easter bunni egg symbol fertil sinc bird lay egg rabbit hare give birth larg litter earli spring becam symbol rise fertil earth adopt earli christian symbol resurrect jesu,B1
33,Elephants,"Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. Traditionally, two species are recognized, the African elephant and the Asian elephant, although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species. Other families of the order Proboscidea, including mammoths and mastodons are now extinct.
Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Male African elephants are the largest surviving terrestrial animals and can reach a height of 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb).
All elephants have several distinctive features the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.
One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the ivory trade, as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people. Elephants are used as working animals in Asia. In the past they were used in war; today, they are often put on display in zoos and circuses.",eleph larg mammal famili elephantida order proboscidea tradit two speci recogn african eleph asian eleph although evid suggest african bush eleph african forest eleph separ speci famili order proboscidea includ mammoth mastodon extinct eleph scatter throughout africa south asia southeast asia male african eleph largest surviv terrestri anim reach height ft weigh kg lb eleph sever distinct featur notabl long trunk probosci use mani purpos particularli breath lift water grasp object incisor grow tusk serv weapon tool move object dig eleph larg ear flap help control bodi temperatur leg carri great weight african eleph larger ear concav back asian eleph smaller ear convex level back one biggest threat eleph popul ivori trade anim poach ivori tusk threat wild eleph includ habitat destruct conflict local peopl eleph use work anim asia past use war today often put display zoo circus,B1
34,Democracy,"The term Democracy comes from the Greek words dÃªmos (people) and Kratos (power). In its literal meaning, democracy means the ""rule of the people"". In fact it is a form of government in which all eligible people have an equal say in the decisions that affect their lives. Democracy as a political systems existed in some Greek city-states, notably Athens following a popular uprising in 508 BC.
Equality and freedom have both been identified as important characteristics of democracy since ancient times.These principles are reflected in all citizens being equal before the law and having equal access to legislative processes. For example, in a representative democracy, every vote has equal weight, no unreasonable restrictions can apply to anyone seeking to become a representative, and the freedom of its citizens is secured by legitimized rights and liberties which are generally protected by a constitution.
There are several varieties of democracy, some of which provide better representation and more freedom for their citizens than others. However, if any democracy is not structured so as to prohibit the government from excluding the people from the legislative process, or any branch of government from altering the separation of powers in its own favor, then a branch of the system can accumulate too much power and destroy the democracy. Separation of powers is a model of governance under which the state is divided into branches, each with separate and independent powers and areas of responsibility so that no one branch has more power than the other branches. The normal division of branches is into an executive, a legislature, and a judiciary.",term democraci come greek word dãªmo peopl krato power liter mean democraci mean rule peopl fact form govern elig peopl equal say decis affect live democraci polit system exist greek notabl athen follow popular upris bc equal freedom identifi import characterist democraci sinc ancient principl reflect citizen equal law equal access legisl process exampl repres democraci everi vote equal weight unreason restrict appli anyon seek becom repres freedom citizen secur legitim right liberti gener protect constitut sever varieti democraci provid better represent freedom citizen other howev democraci structur prohibit govern exclud peopl legisl process branch govern alter separ power favor branch system accumul much power destroy democraci separ power model govern state divid branch separ independ power area respons one branch power branch normal divis branch execut legislatur judiciari,C1
35,Obesity,"Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have an adverse effect on health, leading to reduced life expectancy and/or increased health problems. Body mass index (BMI), a measurement which compares weight and height, defines people as overweight (pre-obese) when their BMI is between 25 kg/m2 and 30 kg/m2, and obese when it is greater than 30 kg/m2.
Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases, particularly heart disease, type 2 diabetes, breathing difficulties during sleep, certain types of cancer, and osteoarthritis. Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive dietary calories, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility, although a few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications or psychiatric illness. Evidence to support the view that some obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is limited; on average obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their thin counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass.
The primary treatment for obesity is dieting and physical exercise. To supplement this, or in case of failure, anti-obesity drugs may be taken to reduce appetite or inhibit fat absorption. In severe cases, surgery is performed or an intragastric balloon is placed to reduce stomach volume and/or bowel length, leading to earlier satiation and reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food.
Obesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide, with increasing prevalence in adults and children, and authorities view it as one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century. Obesity is stigmatized in much of the modern world (particularly in the Western world), though it was widely perceived as a symbol of wealth and fertility at other times in history, and still is in some parts of the world.",obes medic condit excess bodi fat accumul extent may advers effect health lead reduc life expect increas health problem bodi mass index bmi measur compar weight height defin peopl overweight bmi obes greater obes increas likelihood variou diseas particularli heart diseas type diabet breath difficulti sleep certain type cancer osteoarthr obes commonli caus combin excess dietari calori lack physic activ genet suscept although case caus primarili gene endocrin disord medic psychiatr ill evid support view obes peopl eat littl yet gain weight due slow metabol limit averag obes peopl greater energi expenditur thin counterpart due energi requir maintain increas bodi mass primari treatment obes diet physic exercis supplement case failur drug may taken reduc appetit inhibit fat absorpt sever case surgeri perform intragastr balloon place reduc stomach volum bowel length lead earlier satiat reduc abil absorb nutrient food obes lead prevent caus death worldwid increas preval adult child author view one seriou public health problem centuri obes stigmat much modern world particularli western world though wide perceiv symbol wealth fertil time histori still part world,C1
36,Great depression,"The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic depression in the decade preceding World War II. In most countries the depression started in about 1929 and lasted until the late 1930s or early 1940s. It was the longest, most widespread, and deepest depression of the 20th century. In the 21st century, the Great Depression is commonly used as an example of how far the world's economy can decline.
The depression originated in the U.S. Economic historians usually attribute the start of the Great Depression to the sudden devastating collapse of US stock market prices on October 29, 1929, known as Black Tuesday; some dispute this conclusion, and see the stock crash as a symptom, rather than a cause, of the Great Depression
There were multiple causes for the first downturn in 1929 but the real causes are still unclear. Historians emphasize structural factors like major bank failures and the stock market crash. In contrast, some economists point to monetary factors such as actions by the US Federal Reserve that contracted the money supply, as well as Britain's decision to return to the Gold Standard at pre–World War I parities.
The Great Depression had devastating effects in virtually every country, rich and poor. Personal income, tax revenue, profits and prices dropped, while international trade plunged by more than 50%. Unemployment in the U.S. rose to 25%, and in some countries rose as high as 33%. Cities all around the world were hit hard, especially those dependent on heavy industry. Construction was virtually halted in many countries. Farming and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by approximately 60%. Facing plummeting demand with few alternate sources of jobs, areas dependent on primary sector industries such as cash cropping, mining and logging suffered the most.
Some economies started to recover by the mid-1930s; in many countries the negative effects of the Great Depression lasted until the start of World War II",great depress sever worldwid econom depress decad preced world war ii countri depress start last late earli longest widespread deepest depress centuri centuri great depress commonli use exampl far world economi declin depress origin econom historian usual attribut start great depress sudden devast collaps u stock market price octob known black tuesday disput conclus see stock crash symptom rather caus great depress multipl caus first downturn real caus still unclear historian emphas structur factor like major bank failur stock market crash contrast economist point monetari factor action u feder reserv contract money suppli well britain decis return gold standard war pariti great depress devast effect virtual everi countri rich poor person incom tax revenu profit price drop intern trade plung unemploy rose countri rose high citi around world hit hard especi depend heavi industri construct virtual halt mani countri farm rural area suffer crop price fell approxim face plummet demand altern sourc job area depend primari sector industri cash crop mine log suffer economi start recov mani countri neg effect great depress last start world war ii,C1
37,New year eve,"New Year's Eve, also called Old Year's Night, is celebrated on December 31st, the final day of the year. It is celebrated all over the world with parties and social gathering with usually a lot of fireworks and noise.
In the United States of America, New York is the place where this celebration is associated with. People gather in the Times Square just before midnight in the last minute of the countdown to see the ""ball dropping"".
The celebration is also associated with parties in other parts of the world. In France, for instance, the celebration is called le Réveillon. Special food is prepared accompanied with champagne. People also go to the Eiffel Tower in Paris to see fireworks display. In Japan, people traditionally clean their home. Buddhist temple bells are rung 108 times at midnight. In Brazil, the beach of Copacabana is considered by many to be the place of the most beautiful fireworks show in the world.
On New Year's Eve, people commit themselves with resolutions. These are made to reform a habit and should go into effect and remain until fulfillment.",new year eve also call old year night celebr decemb final day year celebr world parti social gather usual lot firework nois unit state america new york place celebr associ peopl gather time squar midnight last minut countdown see ball drop celebr also associ parti part world franc instanc celebr call le réveillon special food prepar accompani champagn peopl also go eiffel tower pari see firework display japan peopl tradit clean home buddhist templ bell rung time midnight brazil beach copacabana consid mani place beauti firework show world new year eve peopl commit resolut made reform habit go effect remain fulfil,B2
38,Short biography of marcus aurelius,"Marcus Aurelius was one of the most renowned emperors in Roman history, known for his intellectual interests and philosophical ideas. He was born into a well-to-do family with political clout. Marcus Aurelius was a devoted student who studied Latin and Greek as a child. But it was Stoicism, a philosophy that stressed fate, reason, and self-control, that piqued his intellectual curiosity. Marcus Aurelius was greatly influenced by Discourses, a book that was authored by Epictetus, a former slave and Stoic philosopher.
Marcus was born during the reign of Hadrian. He was raised by his mother and grandfather after the death of his father when he was three years old. Emperor Hadrian was impressed by Aurelius’ seriousness and diligence. Hadrian chose Titus Aurelius Antoninus who was later known as Emperor Pius Antonius, to succeed him as emperor when his first option for a successor died. Hadrian also arranged for Antoninus to adopt Marcus. While learning the ropes of government and public affairs, he worked alongside his adopted father.
Marcus Aurelius was elected consul, or senate leader, in 140, a position he would occupy twice more throughout his career. As time went on, he was given additional responsibilities and official powers, and he grew to be a valuable source of support and advice for Antoninus. Marcus Aurelius also pursued his philosophical education and became interested in law.
Marcus Aurelius appeared to have a happy personal life in addition to his growing political career. In 145, he married Faustina, the Emperor's daughter. They had several children together. Some of them did not survive long. Lucilla, their daughter, and Commodus, their son, are the most well-known members of the family.
Marcus Aurelius faced many challenges during his reign:
Marcus Aurelius is renowned for his contemplative character and rule based on reason, rather than on the battles he fought. Within his lifetime, he earned the label of philosopher king, which he would keep after his death. The Meditations is a book that contains a collection of his ideas. The work is packed with his observations about life, which are based on his Stoic ideas.",marcu aureliu one renown emperor roman histori known intellectu interest philosoph idea born famili polit clout marcu aureliu devot student studi latin greek child stoicism philosophi stress fate reason piqu intellectu curio marcu aureliu greatli influenc discours book author epictetu former slave stoic philosoph marcu born reign hadrian rais mother grandfath death father three year old emperor hadrian impress aureliu serious dilig hadrian chose titu aureliu antoninu later known emperor piu antoniu succeed emperor first option successor die hadrian also arrang antoninu adopt marcu learn rope govern public affair work alongsid adopt father marcu aureliu elect consul senat leader posit would occupi twice throughout career time went given addit respons offici power grew valuabl sourc support advic antoninu marcu aureliu also pursu philosoph educ becam interest law marcu aureliu appear happi person life addit grow polit career marri faustina emperor daughter sever child togeth surviv long lucilla daughter commodu son member famili marcu aureliu face mani challeng reign marcu aureliu renown contempl charact rule base reason rather battl fought within lifetim earn label philosoph king would keep death medit book contain collect idea work pack observ life base stoic idea,B2
39,Digital divide,"The term digital divide refers to the gap between those who have ready access to computers and the Internet, and those who do not. More precisely, it is an economic and social inequality with regard to access to, use of, or impact of information and communication technologies (ICT). This definition includes the skills to make use of ICT as an important element. Research shows that the digital divide is more than just an access issue and cannot be alleviated merely by providing the necessary equipment. More than just accessibility, individuals need to know how to make use of the information and communication tools once they exist within a community.
The digital divide may exist within the same country or between differing countries or regions of the world. In fact, within many countries including the industrialized ones, there are inequalities between individuals, households, businesses, or geographic areas, usually at different socioeconomic levels. For instance, the marginalized members of society, like the poor, rural, elderly, and handicapped portion of the population do not have access to computers or the internet. However, the wealthy, middle-class population and those living in urban areas are luckier to be digitally active members of society.
At the global level, the digital divide may refer to the divide between differing countries or regions of the world. This divide is also called global digital divide and it exists mainly between developing and developed countries on an international scale. In fact, developing countries are missing a historic opportunity to take a quantum leap forward to develop their own productive and creative capacities, and become integrated into the global virtual economy. It is believed that less developed nations could gain quick access to economic growth if the information infrastructure were to be developed and well used. By improving the latest technologies, certain countries and industries are able to gain a competitive advantage.

40,Very short summary of animal farm by george orwell,"George Orwell's Animal Farm is a short novel written during World War II and published in 1945. It tells the story of a group of farm animals who revolt against their keeper. They want to create a place where all animals are treated equally and where they can be free and happy. However, they are eventually betrayed by one of them, and the farm returns to its previous state.
The narrative is an allegory, which means the author intended it to symbolize true events. It is one of the most well-known political allegories. It is based on the betrayal of the Russian Revolution by Joseph Stalin.
Mr. Jones, a harsh and drunken farmer, manages Manor Farm. The animals gather one day to hear Old Major, a wise old pig, speak. Old Major delivers a speech in which he urges animals to revolt against their farmers. The proposition enthralled the animals. A few days later, Old Major passes away. The most intelligent creatures of the farm, the pigs, begin plotting a revolt. Snowball and Napoleon are in charge.
The animals revolt against Mr. Jones and take over the farm three months later. The name of the farm is changed to ""Animal Farm."" They agree that the farm will now be run entirely by animals, a system they refer to as ""animalism."" They decide to run the farm according to seven commandments, the most important of which is ""All animals are equal."" The phrase ""four legs good, two legs bad"" becomes a popular sheep song. Mr. Jones and his friends attack the farm in an attempt to reclaim it, but the animals drive them away in the ""Battle of the Cowshed."" Mr. Jones flees. They never see him again.
Snowball and Napoleon had a falling out because they have opposing viewpoints on how Animal Farm should be run. Napoleon disagrees with Snowball's ideas to build a windmill. Napoleon trains nine puppies into ferocious dogs. They will be his servants and plans to employ them to chase Snowball off the land once they are fully grown. He eventually seizes control of the farm and runs it alone (as a dictator). While a pig named Squealer constantly persuades the animals that everything is OK and that they should support Napoleon. At the same time, Napoleon uses the dogs to kill any animal that does not agree with him.
Napoleon reconsiders his position and chooses to construct a windmill, claiming that it was his idea all along. The first windmill they built failed. Napoleon accuses Snowball of this (and other issues). Snowball, he claims, is snooping around Animal Farm and destroying everything. For ""being in contact with Snowball,"" many animals are murdered mercilessly. Napoleon begins working with humans outside, despite the fact that this was previously forbidden. One of them is their next-door neighbor, Mr. Frederick, a farmer. He sends a group of men to the farm. They destroy the second windmill. In the ""Battle of the Windmill,"" the animals fight them off at considerable cost.
Boxer, their strongest horse, loses his power due to old age and collapses as the animals were building the third windmill. Despite the fact that Boxer was faithful to Napoleon, he is sent to be killed. The pigs continue to cooperate with people and begin to adopt human characteristics, such as living in the farmhouse and walking on two legs. The sheep are taught a new chant: ""Four legs are good, two legs better."" ""All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others,"" replaces the previously set commandments. Eventually, some animals observe the pigs conversing with a group of people and conclude that they cannot identify which is which.
Animal Farm's fundamental message is that absolute power corrupts, in spite of being based on idealism and good intentions. The story's events are an analogy for the 1917 Russian Revolution, in which the bolsheviks removed the tsar and installed a communist dictatorship.
Despite being rejected by multiple publishers, the book went on to become a best-seller once it was published. Animal Farm is widely regarded as a classic and is one of Orwelll's two best-known books, the other being Nineteen Eighty-Four.",georg orwel anim farm short novel written world war ii publish tell stori group farm anim revolt keeper want creat place anim treat equal free happi howev eventu betray one farm return previou state narr allegori mean author intend symbol true event one polit allegori base betray russian revolut joseph stalin jone harsh drunken farmer manag manor farm anim gather one day hear old major wise old pig speak old major deliv speech urg anim revolt farmer proposit enthral anim day later old major pas away intellig creatur farm pig begin plot revolt snowbal napoleon charg anim revolt jone take farm three month later name farm chang anim farm agre farm run entir anim system refer anim decid run farm accord seven command import anim equal phrase four leg good two leg bad becom popular sheep song jone friend attack farm attempt reclaim anim drive away battl cowsh jone flee never see snowbal napoleon fall oppos viewpoint anim farm run napoleon disagre snowbal idea build windmil napoleon train nine puppi feroci dog servant plan employ chase snowbal land fulli grown eventu seiz control farm run alon dictat pig name squealer constantli persuad anim everyth ok support napoleon time napoleon use dog kill anim agre napoleon reconsid posit choos construct windmil claim idea along first windmil built fail napoleon accus snowbal issu snowbal claim snoop around anim farm destroy everyth contact snowbal mani anim murder mercilessli napoleon begin work human outsid despit fact previous forbidden one neighbor frederick farmer send group men farm destroy second windmil battl windmil anim fight consider cost boxer strongest hors lose power due old age collaps anim build third windmil despit fact boxer faith napoleon sent kill pig continu cooper peopl begin adopt human characterist live farmhous walk two leg sheep taught new chant four leg good two leg better anim equal anim equal other replac previous set command eventu anim observ pig convers group peopl conclud identifi anim farm fundament messag absolut power corrupt spite base ideal good intent stori event analog russian revolut bolshevik remov tsar instal communist dictatorship despit reject multipl publish book went becom publish anim farm wide regard classic one orwell two book nineteen,B2

It is an international organization whose stated aims are facilitating cooperation in international law, international security, economic development, social progress, human rights, and achievement of world peace. The philosophy behind its establishment is to stop wars between countries, and to provide a platform for dialogue. The members of the UN consist of 193 member states, including every internationally recognized sovereign state in the world but Vatican City. The UN is headed by a Secretary-General.
Some rominent UN System agencies include the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Food Programme (WFP) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).

43,Couscous,"Couscous is a North African dish of small steamed balls of semolina. It is a staple food throughout the North African cuisines of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Libya and to a lesser extent in the Middle East and Trapani in Sicily. The original name of this dish may be derived from the arabic word Kaskasa or the Berber word Keskes, which refers to the cooking pot in which the dish is prepared.
The origin of couscous is uncertain. Historians differ about the dates of its appearance. Some affirm that Berbers were preparing couscous as early as 238 to 149 BC, describing primitive couscous pots found in tombs dating back to the reign of the Berber King Massinissa. Nevertheless, Charles Perry states that couscous originated between the end of the Zirid dynasty and the rise of the Almohadian dynasty in North Africa between the eleventh and the thirteenth centuries.
In the past women used to prepare the semolina themselves through a long process. The semolina used to be sprinkled with water and rolled with the hands to form small pellets. Today, the couscous that is sold in most supermarkets has been pre-steamed and dried.
Couscous is generally served with vegetables such as carrots, pumpkin, turnips, etc.. It is cooked in a spicy or mild broth or stew, and some meat, generally, chicken, lamb or mutton.",couscou north african dish small steam ball semolina stapl food throughout north african cuisin morocco algeria tunisia mauritania libya lesser extent middl east trapani sicili origin name dish may deriv arab word kaskasa berber word kesk refer cook pot dish prepar origin couscou uncertain historian differ date appear affirm berber prepar couscou earli bc describ primit couscou pot found tomb date back reign berber king massinissa nevertheless charl perri state couscou origin end zirid dynasti rise almohadian dynasti north africa eleventh thirteenth centuri past woman use prepar semolina long process semolina use sprinkl water roll hand form small pellet today couscou sold supermarket dri couscou gener serv veget carrot pumpkin turnip etc cook spici mild broth stew meat gener chicken lamb mutton,B2
44,Summer,"Summer is the warmest of the four temperate seasons which also include winter spring and autumn. It occurs between spring and autumn. It is known for the longest days and shortest nights. The seasons start on different dates in different cultures based on astronomy and regional meteorology. However, when it is summer in the southern hemisphere it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa. Summer is traditionally associated with hot dry weather, but this does not occur in all regions. For example, the wet season occurs during summer across many parts of the tropics and subtropics. Tropical cyclones develop and roam the tropical and subtropical oceans during the summer. In the interior of continents, thunderstorms are most likely to produce hail during the afternoon and evening. Schools and universities have a summer break to take advantage of the warmer weather and longer days.
People take advantage of the warmer temperatures by spending more time outdoors during the summer. Activities such as traveling to the beach and picnics occur during summer months. Sports such as cricket, volleyball, skateboarding, baseball, softball, soccer, tennis, water polo, and football are played. Water skiing is a uniquely summer sport, which is done when waters approach their warmest of the year.",summer warmest four temper season also includ winter spring autumn occur spring autumn known longest day shortest night season start differ date differ cultur base astronomi region meteorolog howev summer southern hemispher winter northern hemispher vice versa summer tradit associ hot dri weather occur region exampl wet season occur summer across mani part tropic subtrop tropic cyclon develop roam tropic subtrop ocean summer interior contin thunderstorm like produc hail afternoon even school univers summer break take advantag warmer weather longer day peopl take advantag warmer temperatur spend time outdoor summer activ travel beach picnic occur summer month sport cricket volleybal skateboard basebal softbal soccer tenni water polo footbal play water ski uniqu summer sport done water approach warmest year,B1
45,Organizations unicef,"UNICEF stands for United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund. It was created by the United Nations General Assembly on December 11, 1946, to provide emergency food and health care to children in countries that had been devastated by World War II.
In 1954, UNICEF became a permanent part of the United Nations System. UNICEF relies on contributions from governments and private donors. Governments contribute two thirds of the organization's resources; private groups and some 6 million individuals contribute the rest through the National Committees. Most of UNICEF's work is in the field, with staff in over 190 countries and territories. More than 200 country offices carry out UNICEF's mission through a program developed with host governments. Seven regional offices provide technical assistance to country offices as needed.
UNICEF's programs emphasize developing community-level services to promote the health and well-being of children.

It was first established in 1961 after the 1960 Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) Conference, when George McGovern, director of the US Food for Peace Programmes, proposed establishing a multilateral food aid programme. WFP was formally established in 1963 by the FAO and the United Nations General Assembly on a three-year experimental basis. In 1965, the programme was extended to a continuing basis.
WFP provides food, on average, to 90 million people per year, 58 million of whom are children. From its headquarters in Rome and more than 80 country offices around the world, WFP works to help people who are unable to produce or obtain enough food for themselves and their families. It is a member of the United Nations Development Group and part of its Executive Committee.

47,Edgar allan poe biography,"Edgar Allan Poe was born on January 19, 1809 in Boston, Massachusetts. He was an American author, poet, editor, and literary critic, considered part of the American Romantic Movement. Poe is famous for his tales of mystery and the macabre. He was one of the earliest American practitioners of the short story, and is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre
Both Poe’s father and mother were professional actors. They died before the poet was three years old. John and Frances Allan raised him as a foster child in Richmond, Virginia. Poe attended the University of Virginia for one semester but left due to lack of money. Poe quarreled with Allan over the funds for his education and enlisted in the Army in 1827 under an assumed name. It was at this time his publishing career began, although humbly, with an anonymous collection of poems, Tamerlane and Other Poems (1827), credited only to ""a Bostonian"". With the death of Frances Allan in 1829, Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement. Later failing as an officer's cadet at West Point and declaring a firm wish to be a poet and writer, Poe parted ways with John Allan.
After his early attempts at poetry, Poe had turned his attention to prose. He spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary criticism. His work forced him to move among several cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. In Baltimore in 1835, he married Virginia Clemm, his 13-year-old cousin.
In January 1845 Poe published his poem, ""The Raven"", to instant success. His wife died of tuberculosis two years after its publication. For years, he had been planning to produce his own journal, The Penn (later renamed The Stylus), though he died before it could be produced. On October 7, 1849, at age 40, Poe died in Baltimore; the cause of his death is unknown and has been variously attributed to alcohol, brain congestion, cholera, drugs, heart disease, rabies, suicide, tuberculosis, and other agents.
Edgar Allan Poe and his works influenced literature in the United States and around the world, as well as in specialized fields. He is considered as one of the originators of both horror and detective fiction. He is also credited as the “architect” of the modern short story. As a critic he was one of the first writers to put emphasis on the effect of style and structure. He was thus a forerunner to the ""art for art's sake"" movement. Poe is particularly respected in France, in part due to early translations by Charles Baudelaire. Baudelaire's translations became definitive renditions of Poe's work throughout Europe.
Poe and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films, and television. A number of his homes are dedicated museums today.

48,Modern olympic games,"Originally, the ancient Olympic Games were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. However, Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894 and initiated the modern Olympic Games.
As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Olympic Games. The host city is responsible for organizing and funding a celebration of the Games. The Olympic program, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games, is also determined by the IOC. The celebration of the Games encompasses many rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies.
The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Games for ice and winter sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with a physical disability, and the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes. The IOC has had to adapt to the varying economic, political, and technological realities of the 20th century.
The Games have grown in scale to the point that nearly every nation is represented. Such growth has created numerous challenges, including boycotts, doping, bribery, and terrorism. At each event of the games, the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national, and in some cases, international fame. The Games also constitute a major opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.",origin ancient olymp game held olympia greec centuri bc centuri ad howev baron pierr de coubertin found intern olymp committe ioc initi modern olymp game bodi ioc respons choos host citi olymp game host citi respons organ fund celebr game olymp program consist sport contest game also determin ioc celebr game encompass mani ritual symbol olymp flag torch well open close ceremoni evolut olymp movement centuri result sever chang olymp game adjust includ creation winter game ice winter sport paralymp game athlet physic disabl youth olymp game teenag athlet ioc adapt vari econom polit technolog realiti centuri game grown scale point nearli everi nation repres growth creat numer challeng includ boycott dope briberi terror event game olymp medium exposur provid unknown athlet chanc attain nation case intern fame game also constitut major opportun host citi countri showcas world,B2
49,Dolphins,"Dolphins are marine mammals closely related to whales and porpoises. The name is originally from Greek (delphus), meaning womb. The animal's name can therefore be interpreted as meaning a fish with a womb. Along with whales and porpoises, dolphins are descendants of terrestrial mammals. There are almost forty species of dolphin and are found worldwide. They are carnivores, eating mostly fish and squid. Dolphins are members of the family Delphinidae which evolved relatively recently, about ten million years ago.
Doplhins' senses are very developed. Most dolphins have acute eyesight, both in and out of the water, and they can hear frequencies ten times or more above the upper limit of adult human hearing. Hearing is also used for echolocation, which all dolphins have. Dolphin teeth are believed to function as antennae to receive incoming sound and to pinpoint the exact location of an object. Beyond locating an object, echolocation also provides the animal with an idea on the object's shape and size, though how exactly this works is not yet understood. The dolphin's sense of touch is also well-developed, with free nerve endings densely packed in the skin, especially around the snout, pectoral fins and genital area. However, dolphins lack an olfactory nerve and lobes, and thus are believed to have no sense of smell. They do have a sense of taste and show preferences for certain kinds of fish.
Dolphins are capable of making a broad range of sounds using nasal airsacs located just below the blowhole. Individual dolphins communicate using a variety of clicks, whistle-like sounds and other vocalizations. The clicks are directional and are for echolocation, often occurring in a short series called a click train. The click rate increases when approaching an object of interest. Dolphin echolocation clicks are amongst the loudest sounds made by marine animals.",dolphin marin mammal close relat whale porpois name origin greek delphu mean womb anim name therefor interpret mean fish womb along whale porpois dolphin descend terrestri mammal almost forti speci dolphin found worldwid carnivor eat mostli fish squid dolphin member famili delphinida evolv rel recent ten million year ago doplhin sen develop dolphin acut eyesight water hear frequenc ten time upper limit adult human hear hear also use echoloc dolphin dolphin teeth believ function antenna receiv incom sound pinpoint exact locat object beyond locat object echoloc also provid anim idea object shape size though exactli work yet understood dolphin sen touch also free nerv end den pack skin especi around snout pector fin genit area howev dolphin lack olfactori nerv lobe thu believ sen smell sen tast show prefer certain kind fish dolphin capabl make broad rang sound use nasal airsac locat blowhol individu dolphin commun use varieti click sound vocal click direct echoloc often occur short seri call click train click rate increas approach object interest dolphin echoloc click amongst loudest sound made marin anim,B2
50,Coronavirus,"Coronaviruses were discovered in the 1960s. They are a group of viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that are typically mild, such as the common cold.
The name ""coronavirus"" is derived from the Latin corona, meaning crown or halo. The name refers to the characteristic appearance of the infective form of the virus, which is reminiscent of a crown or a solar corona.
At the end of 2019, a new type of coronavirus started spreading in China. This type of coronavirus is often called 2019-nCoV, novel coronavirus, or COVID-19. It is believed that the virus was transmitted from animals to humans. Some of the first cases were diagnosed in people who had visited a market selling live seafood and animals. Unfortunately, when viruses are transmitted from animals to people, it can take scientists a lot of time before they can develop a vaccine or medicines to cure it.
Some of the symptoms of the coronavirus are fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat, headache, and trouble breathing. These symptoms are very much like those people have with a cold or the flu. The virus can be more serious in some people, especially if they are sick or have health problems.
While it is early to have a definite picture of the disease because scientists are still collecting the data, some patterns have already emerged. Some early reports reveal that children seem to be getting coronavirus at much lower rates than adults. Even if they get infected, the symptoms are milder. However, most people who get severely infected are those with a weak immune system, like the elderly. Coronavirus may be life-threatening for these people. They may develop more serious respiratory tract illnesses that may be fatal.
The virus appears to spread mainly from person to person. The transmission occurs when someone comes into contact with an infected person. For example, a cough, sneeze or handshake could cause transmission. The spread may also be caused by coming into contact with something an infected person has touched and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes.
There is no specific vaccine or medication to cure the disease, but generally, symptoms will go away on their own. However, experts recommend seeking medical care early if symptoms feel worse than a standard cold. Doctors can relieve symptoms by prescribing pain or fever medication. As far as antibiotics are concerned, they are useless to treat coronavirus.
People who think they may have been exposed to the virus should contact their healthcare provider immediately. A set of preventive measures are usually followed in case someone gets infected. This includes keeping infected people in quarantine for a certain period, generally fourteen days.
To protect yourself from the virus, here are six recommendations to follow:",coronavirus discov group virus caus diseas mammal bird human coronavirus caus respiratori tract infect typic mild common cold name coronaviru deriv latin corona mean crown halo name refer characterist appear infect form viru reminisc crown solar corona end new type coronaviru start spread china type coronaviru often call novel coronaviru believ viru transmit anim human first case diagnos peopl visit market sell live seafood anim unfortun virus transmit anim peopl take scientist lot time develop vaccin medicin cure symptom coronaviru fever cough runni nose sore throat headach troubl breath symptom much like peopl cold flu viru seriou peopl especi sick health problem earli definit pictur diseas scientist still collect data pattern alreadi emerg earli report reveal child seem get coronaviru much lower rate adult even get infect symptom milder howev peopl get sever infect weak immun system like elderli coronaviru may peopl may develop seriou respiratori tract ill may fatal viru appear spread mainli person person transmiss occur someon come contact infect person exampl cough sneez handshak could caus transmiss spread may also caus come contact someth infect person touch touch mouth nose eye specif vaccin medic cure diseas gener symptom go away howev expert recommend seek medic care earli symptom feel wors standard cold doctor reliev symptom prescrib pain fever medic far antibiot concern useless treat coronaviru peopl think may expo viru contact healthcar provid immedi set prevent measur usual follow case someon get infect includ keep infect peopl quarantin certain period gener fourteen day protect viru six recommend follow,B2
51,Citizenship,"Citizenship is a sacred honor, a plaque we carry proudly on our chests and a burden pressing hard on our backs. A citizen is a member of a country. He has the right to ask for its protection, and the duty to protect it and obey its laws and rules. In other words, citizenship is the relationship between an individual and a state in which the individual belongs, and owes allegiance to the state and in turn is entitled to its protection.
Fortunately, being a good citizen doesn't stop at the exchange of rights and duties, it requires a lot of civilized behavior, and responsible acts.
All the members of our community, from the youngest to the eldest, have to cooperate. By cooperating, I don’t mean giving huge efforts. Simple acts and easy behavior can help us ameliorate our level of life. As citizens, and students in particular, all we have to do are the steps below :
When you become a parent, teach this to your children. Citizenship starts from childhood, and only ends by the time you die. It’s only by practicing those really simple acts that our daily life can get better. I hope this will help us understand another meaning of good citizenship.",citizenship sacr honor plaqu carri proudli chest burden press hard back citizen member countri right ask protect duti protect obey law rule word citizenship relationship individu state individu belong owe allegi state turn entitl protect fortun good citizen stop exchang right duti requir lot civil behavior respons act member commun youngest eldest cooper cooper mean give huge effort simpl act easi behavior help u amelior level life citizen student particular step becom parent teach child citizenship start childhood end time die practic realli simpl act daili life get better hope help u understand anoth mean good citizenship,B2
52,Spanish flu 1918,"The Spanish flu, also known as the 1918 flu pandemic, was a deadly pandemic in recent history. It spread worldwide during the year 1918-1919. The virus infected 500 million people – about a third of the world's population at the time. The death toll was estimated to be at least 50 million worldwide, possibly as high as 100 million. This makes it the severest pandemic in human history.
The outbreak of the Spanish flu was caused by an H1N1 virus with genes of avian origin. Historians now believe that World War I could have been partly responsible for spreading the virus. Lack of hygiene and malnourishment may have also been responsible for weakening the immune system. For example, a 2007 analysis of medical journals from the period of the pandemic found that the viral infection was no more aggressive than previous influenza strains. Instead, malnourishment, overcrowded medical camps and hospitals, and poor hygiene, all exacerbated by the recent war, promoted bacterial superinfection.
There is no agreement about the origin of the virus. The 1918 flu was first observed in Europe, the United States, and parts of Asia before swiftly spreading around the world. It is believed that censorship was the main reason why this pandemic was referred to as the Spanish flu. To maintain morale, World War I censors minimized early reports of illness and mortality in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. However, newspapers were free to report the epidemic's effects in neutral Spain, such as the grave illness of King Alfonso XIII, and these stories created a false impression of Spain as especially hard hit. This gave rise to the name 'Spanish flu'. Historical and epidemiological data are inadequate to identify with certainty the pandemic's geographic origin, with varying views as to its location.
Nearly a century after the Spanish flu struck, the World Health Organization (WHO) called on scientists, national authorities and the media to follow best practices in naming new human infectious diseases to minimize unnecessary negative effects on nations, economies, and people. More modern terms for this virus include the ""1918 influenza pandemic,"" the ""1918 flu pandemic,"" or variations of these.
At least 50 million died worldwide.It is interesting to note that most influenza outbreaks disproportionately kill the very young and the very old, with a higher survival rate for those in between, but the Spanish flu pandemic resulted in a higher than expected mortality rate for young adults.

53,Brief history of vikings,"The Vikings are commonly depicted as invaders, predators, and barbarians. Who were they? Where did they come from? What's the truth about their raids? One thing is sure, the history of the Vikings is not characterized only by raiding and plundering. The Vikings developed a complex and often sophisticated Scandinavian culture. In addition to their well-known raids, they were traders, artists, poets, skilled craftsmen, and sailors.
The Vikings originated from Scandinavia - Danemark, Norway, and Sweden. These lands were mainly rural. The only sources of living were agriculture and fishing. The Viking society was divided into three socio-economic classes, namely, the Thralls, Karls and Jarls. The Thralls were the lowest ranking class and were slaves. Slaves comprised as much as a quarter of the population. The Karls, however, were free peasants. They owned farms, land, and cattle and engaged in daily chores like plowing the fields, milking the cattle, building houses and wagons, but used thralls to make ends meet. Other names for Karls were 'bonde' or simply free men. The Jarls were the aristocracy of the Viking society. They were wealthy and owned large estates with huge longhouses, horses and many thralls. The thralls did most of the daily chores, while the Jarls did administration, politics, hunting, sports, visited other Jarls or were abroad on expeditions. When a Jarl died and was buried, his household thralls were sometimes sacrificially killed and buried next to him, as many excavations have revealed.
Historians disagree about the origin of the word Viking. One theory is that the word possibly comes from the word vik, which in the Old Norse language the Vikings spoke means ‘bay’ or ‘inlet’. What is certain is that people at that time did not call them Vikings. They were called instead Danes, heathens, or Norsemen.
The Vikings were pagans. They believed in a polytheistic religion, entailing a belief in various gods and goddesses. This religion was transmitted through oral culture rather than through codified texts. It focused heavily on ritual practice, with kings and chiefs playing a central role in carrying out public acts of sacrifice. The most popular Vikings gods were Odin, Thor, and Týr. Known as the All-Father, Odin was the god of wisdom, poetry, death, divination, and magic. Thor is the god of thunder and lightning in Norse mythology, associated with strength, storms, hallowing, and fertility. He is the son of Odin and is described as being fierce-eyed, with red hair and a full beard, and he is quick to anger and has an enormous appetite. Týr is considered the god of war. He is considered the most courageous of all the Gods. According to the Norse Mythology, Týr sacrifices his arm to the monstrous wolf Fenrir, who bites off his limb while the gods bind the animal.
From the late 8th to late 11th centuries, the Vikings raided and traded from their Northern European homelands across wide areas of Europe, and explored westwards to Iceland, Greenland, and North America. Facilitated by advanced sailing and navigational skills, Viking activities at times also extended into the Mediterranean littoral, North Africa, and the Middle East. The longship that they designed helped them to explore, expand their activities, and settle in diverse areas of north-western Europe, Belarus, Ukraine, and European Russia, the North Atlantic islands and as far as the north-eastern coast of North America. This period of expansion witnessed the wider dissemination of Norse culture, while simultaneously introducing strong foreign cultural influences into Scandinavia itself, with profound developmental implications in both directions.
From around 860AD onwards, The Vikings raided, settled and prospered in Britain. The earliest recorded planned Viking raid, on 6 January 793, targeted the monastery on the island of Lindisfarne, off the north-east coast of Northumbria. The raiders killed the resident monks or threw them into the sea to drown or carried them away as slaves – along with some of the church treasures.In 875, after enduring eight decades of repeated Viking raids, the monks fled Lindisfarne, carrying the relics of Saint Cuthbert with them.
In the years that followed, the Vikings left no region of Britain safe. They attacked and besieged other villages, monasteries and even cities in Wales, Scotland, Ireland, and England. Only one kingdom, namely Wessex, led by King Alfred the Great, resisted successfully the Vikings raids. Because of this fierce resistance the Norsemen left Wessex and settled to the north, in an area called Danelaw. There the Vikings established York as a leading mercantile city and many of them started farming and trading. There followed the Treaty of Wedmore in 878 and the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum in 886. These treaties formalized the boundaries of the English kingdoms and the Viking Danelaw territory, with provisions for peaceful relations between the English and the Vikings. Despite these treaties, conflicts continued on and off. However, Alfred and his successors eventually drove back the Viking frontier and retook York.
Writing in Latin letters was introduced to Scandinavia with Christianity, so there are few native documentary sources from Scandinavia before the late 11th and early 12th centuries. The Scandinavians did write inscriptions in runes, but these are usually very short and formulaic. Most contemporary documentary sources consist of texts written in Christian and Islamic communities outside Scandinavia, often by authors who had been negatively affected by Viking activity. After the consolidation of the church and the assimilation of Scandinavia and its colonies into the mainstream of medieval Christian culture in the 11th and 12th centuries, native written sources begin to appear, in Latin and Old Norse. For example, many traditions connected with the Viking Age were written down for the first time in the Icelandic sagas. A literal interpretation of these medieval prose narratives about the Vikings and the Scandinavian past is doubtful, but many specific elements remain worthy of consideration, such as the great quantity of poetry of the 10th and 11th centuries, the exposed family trees, the self images, the ethical values, all included in these literary writings.
Old East Norse and Old English were still somewhat mutually comprehensible. The contact between Old East Norse and Old English caused the incorporation of many Norse words into the English language, including the words law, sky and window, and the third person pronouns they, them and their. Many Old Norse words still survive in the dialects of Northern England. The English names for days of the week originate mainly from Vikings gods. For Example, Tuesday comes from Tiw or Týr, Wednesday comes from Woden  or Odin, Thursday comes from Thor and so on.",vike commonli depict invad predat barbarian come truth raid one thing sure histori vike character raid plunder vike develop complex often sophist scandinavian cultur addit raid trader artist poet skill craftsman sailor vike origin scandinavia danemark norway sweden land mainli rural sourc live agricultur fish vike societi divid three class name thrall karl jarl thrall lowest rank class slave slave compris much quarter popul karl howev free peasant own farm land cattl engag daili chore like plow field milk cattl build hous wagon use thrall make end meet name karl simpli free men jarl aristocraci vike societi wealthi own larg estat huge longhous hors mani thrall thrall daili chore jarl administr polit hunt sport visit jarl abroad expedit jarl die buri household thrall sometim sacrifici kill buri next mani excav reveal historian disagre origin word vike one theori word possibl come word vik old nors languag vike spoke mean bay inlet certain peopl time call vike call instead dane heathen norseman vike pagan believ polytheist religion entail belief variou god goddess religion transmit oral cultur rather codifi text focus heavili ritual practic king chief play central role carri public act sacrific popular vike god odin thor týr known odin god wisdom poetri death divin magic thor god thunder lightn nors mytholog associ strength storm hallow fertil son odin describ red hair full beard quick anger enorm appetit týr consid god war consid courag god accord nors mytholog týr sacrific arm monstrou wolf fenrir bite limb god bind anim late late centuri vike raid trade northern european homeland across wide area europ explor westward iceland greenland north america facilit advanc sail navig skill vike activ time also extend mediterranean littor north africa middl east longship design help explor expand activ settl diver area europ belaru ukrain european russia north atlant island far coast north america period expans wit wider dissemin nors cultur simultan introduc strong foreign cultur influenc scandinavia profound development implic direct around onward vike raid settl prosper britain earliest record plan vike raid januari target monasteri island lindisfarn coast northumbria raider kill resid monk threw sea drown carri away slave along church endur eight decad repeat vike raid monk fled lindisfarn carri relic saint cuthbert year follow vike left region britain safe attack besieg villag monasteri even citi wale scotland ireland england one kingdom name wessex led king alfr great resist success vike raid fierc resist norseman left wessex settl north area call danelaw vike establish york lead mercantil citi mani start farm trade follow treati wedmor treati alfr guthrum treati formal boundari english kingdom vike danelaw territori provis peac relat english vike despit treati conflict continu howev alfr successor eventu drove back vike frontier retook york write latin letter introduc scandinavia christian nativ documentari sourc scandinavia late earli centuri scandinavian write inscript rune usual short formula contemporari documentari sourc consist text written christian islam commun outsid scandinavia often author neg affect vike activ consolid church assimil scandinavia coloni mainstream mediev christian cultur centuri nativ written sourc begin appear latin old nors exampl mani tradit connect vike age written first time iceland saga liter interpret mediev prose narr vike scandinavian past doubt mani specif element remain worthi consider great quantiti poetri centuri expo famili tree self imag ethic valu includ literari write old east nors old english still somewhat mutual comprehens contact old east nors old english caus incorpor mani nors word english languag includ word law sky window third person pronoun mani old nors word still surviv dialect northern england english name day week origin mainli vike god exampl tuesday come tiw týr wednesday come woden odin thursday come thor,C2
54,Robots,"A robot is a mechanical or virtual artificial agent, usually an electromechanical machine that is guided by a computer program or electronic circuitry. When robots are virtual software agents, they are usually referred to as bots.
The word 'robot' was first used to denote a fictional humanoid in a 1920 play R.U.R. by the Czech writer, Karel Čapek but it was Karel's brother Josef Čapek who was the word's true inventor. In an article in the Czech journal Lidové noviny in 1933, he explained that he had originally wanted to call the creatures featured in the play laboři (""workers"", from Latin labor). However, he did not like the word, and sought advice from his brother Josef, who suggested ""roboti"". The word robota means literally ""corvée"", ""serf labor"", and figuratively ""drudgery"" or ""hard work"" in Czech and also (more general) ""work"", ""labor"" in many Slavic languages.
The branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing is robotics.
In general robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and are now used in different fields. They have replaced humans in performing repetitive and dangerous tasks which humans prefer not to do, or are unable to do because of size limitations, or which take place in extreme environments such as outer space or the bottom of the sea. For instance, robots can now be used in industry, as in car manufacturing, or they can be used in homes to do the housework. Some robots may respond to speech or be even medical operating tools.
In 2008, Caterpillar Inc. developed a dump truck which can drive itself without any human operator. Many analysts believe that self-driving trucks may eventually revolutionize logistics. By 2014, Caterpillar had a self-driving dump truck which is expected to greatly change the process of mining. In 2015. Some analysts believe that within the next few decades, most trucks will be self-driving.
A literate or 'reading robot' named Marge has intelligence that comes from software. She can read newspapers, find and correct misspelled words, learn about banks like Barclays, and understand that some restaurants are better places to eat than others.
Baxter is a new robot which is different from other industrial robots because it can learn. A worker could teach Baxter how to perform a task by moving its hands in the desired motion and having Baxter memorize them. Extra dials, buttons, and controls are available on Baxter's arm for more precision and features. Any regular worker could program Baxter and it only takes a matter of minutes, unlike usual industrial robots that take extensive programs and coding in order to be used. This means Baxter needs no programming in order to operate. No software engineers are needed. This also means Baxter can be taught to perform multiple, more complicated tasks.
There are concerns about the increasing use of robots and their role in society. Robots are blamed for rising unemployment as they replace workers in increasing numbers of functions. The use of robots in military combat raises ethical concerns. The possibilities of robot autonomy and potential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a realistic concern in the future.",robot mechan virtual artifici agent usual electromechan machin guid comput program electron circuitri robot virtual softwar agent usual refer bot word first use denot fiction humanoid play czech writer karel čapek karel brother josef čapek word true inventor articl czech journal lidové novini explain origin want call creatur featur play laboři worker latin labor howev like word sought advic brother josef suggest roboti word robota mean liter corvé serf labor figur drudgeri hard work czech also gener work labor mani slavic languag branch technolog deal design construct oper applic robot well comput system control sensori feedback inform process robot gener robot autonom use differ field replac human perform repetit danger task human prefer unabl size limit take place extrem environ outer space bottom sea instanc robot use industri car manufactur use home housework robot may respond speech even medic oper tool caterpillar develop dump truck drive without human oper mani analyst believ truck may eventu revolution logist caterpillar dump truck expect greatli chang process mine analyst believ within next decad truck liter robot name marg intellig come softwar read newspap find correct misspel word learn bank like barclay understand restaur better place eat other baxter new robot differ industri robot learn worker could teach baxter perform task move hand desir motion baxter memor extra dial button control avail baxter arm precis featur regular worker could program baxter take matter minut unlik usual industri robot take extens program code order use mean baxter need program order oper softwar engin need also mean baxter taught perform multipl complic task concern increas use robot role societi robot blame rise unemploy replac worker increas number function use robot militari combat rais ethic concern possibl robot autonomi potenti repercuss address fiction may realist concern futur,C1
55,Pollution environment issues,"Pollution is the degradation of natural environment by external substances introduced directly or indirectly. Human health, ecosystem quality and aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity may be affected and altered permanently by pollution.
Pollution occurs when ecosystems can not get rid of substances introduced into the environment. The critical threshold of its ability to naturally eliminate substances is compromised and the balance of the ecosystem is broken.
The sources of pollution are numerous. The identification of these different pollutants and their effects on ecosystems is complex. They can come from natural disasters or the result of human activity, such as oil spills, chemical spills, nuclear accidents ... These can have terrible consequences on people and the planet where they live: destruction of the biodiversity, increased mortality of the human and animal species, destruction of natural habitat, damage caused to the quality of soil, water and air.
Preventing pollution and protecting the environment necessitate the application of the principles of sustainable development. we have to consider to satisfy the needs of today without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. This means that we should remedy existing pollution, but also anticipate and prevent future pollution sources in order to protect the environment and public health. Any environmental damage must be punishable by law, and polluters should pay compensation for the damage caused to the environment.",pollut degrad natur environ extern substanc introduc directli indirectli human health ecosystem qualiti aquat terrestri biodivers may affect alter perman pollut pollut occur ecosystem get rid substanc introduc environ critic threshold abil natur elimin substanc compromis balanc ecosystem broken sourc pollut numer identif differ pollut effect ecosystem complex come natur disast result human activ oil spill chemic spill nuclear accid terribl consequ peopl planet live destruct biodivers increas mortal human anim speci destruct natur habitat damag caus qualiti soil water air prevent pollut protect environ necessit applic principl sustain develop consid satisfi need today without compromis abil futur gener meet need mean remedi exist pollut also anticip prevent futur pollut sourc order protect environ public health environment damag must punish law pollut pay compens damag caus environ,C1
56,Eid al adha,"Eid al-Adha or ""Festival of Sacrifice"" or ""Greater Eid"" is an important religious holiday celebrated by Muslims all over the world to commemorate the willingness of Abraham (Ibrahim) to sacrifice his son Ishmael (Isma'il) as an act of obedience to God, before God intervened to provide him with a ram to sacrifice instead. The meat is divided into three parts: the family retains one third of the share, another third is stored and the other third is given to the poor and needy. Eid al-Adha is the latter of two Eid festivals celebrated by Muslims, the first being Eid ul-Fitr. Like Eid ul FitrEid, al-Adha begins with a prayer followed by a sermon. Eid al-Adha is celebrated annually on the 10th day of the 12th and the last Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah of the lunar Islamic calendar. Eid al-Adha celebrations start after the Hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia by Muslims worldwide. The date is approximately 70 days (2 Months and 10 days) after the end of the month of Ramadan. Ritual observance of the holiday lasts until sunset of the 13th day of Dhu al-Hijjah",eid festiv sacrific greater eid import religi holiday celebr muslim world commemor willing abraham ibrahim sacrific son ishmael act obedi god god interven provid ram sacrific instead meat divid three part famili retain one third share anoth third store third given poor needi eid latter two eid festiv celebr muslim first eid like eid ul fitreid begin prayer follow sermon eid celebr annual day last islam month dhu lunar islam calendar eid celebr start hajj annual pilgrimag mecca saudi arabia muslim worldwid date approxim day month day end month ramadan ritual observ holiday last sunset day dhu,B1
57,Whale,"Whale is the common name for various marine mammals of the order Cetacea. Whales breathe air and are not fish. They are mammals that spend their entire lives in the water. Whales are of two types: toothehed (Odontoceti) and balleen (Mysticeti) wales.
Whales breathe via blowholes; baleen whales have two and toothed whales have one. These are located on the top of the head, allowing the animal to remain almost completely submerged whilst breathing. Breathing involves expelling excess water from the blowhole, forming an upward spout, followed by inhaling air into the lungs. Spout shapes differ among species and can help with identification.
The largest whales are blue whales. In fact, the blue whale is the largest animal known to have ever existed at 30 m (98 ft) and 180 tonnes. These huge animals eat about 4 tons of tiny krill each day, obtained by filter feeding through baleen, a comb-like structure that filters the baleen whales' food from the water.",whale common name variou marin mammal order cetacea whale breath air fish mammal spend entir live water whale two type tootheh odontoceti balleen mysticeti wale whale breath via blowhol baleen whale two tooth whale one locat top head allow anim remain almost complet submerg whilst breath breath involv expel excess water blowhol form upward spout follow inhal air lung spout shape differ among speci help identif largest whale blue whale fact blue whale largest anim known ever exist ft tonn huge anim eat ton tini krill day obtain filter feed baleen structur filter baleen whale food water,B2
58,Surrealism,"Surrealism was a cultural movement that began in the early 1920s, and is best known for its visual artworks and writings. The word 'surrealist' was coined by Guillaume Apollinaire and first appeared in the preface to his play Les Mamelles de Tirésias, which was written in 1903 and was first performed in 1917.
The movement sought to release the creative potential of the unconscious mind. It was influenced by psychoanalysis. The Surrealists regarded with contempt rationalism and literary realism and believed the rational mind repressed the power of the imagination, overburdening it with taboos. The aim was to ""resolve the previously contradictory conditions of dream and reality"". Artists painted unnerving, illogical scenes with photographic precision, created strange creatures from everyday objects and developed painting techniques that allowed the unconscious to express itself.
Freud's work with free association, dream analysis, and the unconscious was of utmost importance to the Surrealists in developing methods to liberate imagination. They embraced idiosyncrasy, while rejecting the idea of an underlying madness. As Salvador Dalí, one of the leading surrealists, later proclaimed, ""There is only one difference between a madman and me. I am not mad.""
Surrealist works feature the element of surprise, unexpected juxtapositions and non sequitur; however, many Surrealist artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost, with the works being an artifact. Leader André Breton was explicit in his assertion that Surrealism was, above all, a revolutionary movement.
Surrealism developed largely out of the Dada activities during World War I. In addition to being anti-war, Dada had political affinities with the radical left and was also anti-bourgeois. and. The most important center of the movement was Paris. From the 1920s onward, the movement spread around the globe, eventually affecting the visual arts, literature, film, and music of many countries and languages, as well as political thought and practice, philosophy, and social theory.",surreal cultur movement began earli best known visual artwork write word coin guillaum apollinair first appear prefac play le mamel de tirésia written first perform movement sought releas creativ potenti unconsci mind influenc psychoanalysi surrealist regard contempt ration literari realism believ ration mind repress power imagin overburden taboo aim resolv previous contradictori condit dream realiti artist paint unnerv illog scene photograph precis creat strang creatur everyday object develop paint techniqu allow unconsci express freud work free associ dream analysi unconsci utmost import surrealist develop method liber imagin embrac idiosyncrasi reject idea underli mad salvador dalí one lead surrealist later proclaim one differ madman mad surrealist work featur element surpris unexpect juxtaposit non sequitur howev mani surrealist artist writer regard work express philosoph movement first foremost work artifact leader andré breton explicit assert surreal revolutionari movement surreal develop larg dada activ world war addit dada polit affin radic left also import center movement pari onward movement spread around globe eventu affect visual art literatur film music mani countri languag well polit thought practic philosophi social theori,C2
59,Football world cup south africa,"The 2010 world cup football (soccer) competition will take place in South Africa between June 11 and July 11, 2010. This will be the 19th FIFA World Cup. It is an event that is held every four years.
This will be the first time that the world cup is held in an African country. South Africa competed against Morocco, Egypt, Tunisia and Libya ( Tunisia and Libya offered to co-host the competition) for the organization of the event. Following the decision of the FIFA Executive Committee not to allow co-hosted tournaments, Tunisia withdrew from the bidding process. The committee also decided not to consider Libya's solo bid as it no longer met all the stipulations laid down in the official List of Requirements. After one round of voting, the winning bid was announced by FIFA president Sepp Blatter at a media conference on 15 May 2004 in Zürich. South Africa was awarded the rights to host the tournament as it got 14 votes, defeating Morocco (10 votes) and Egypt (0 votes)
During 2006 to 2007, a lot of rumors circulated in various news sources that the 2010 World Cup could be moved to another country. Some people expressed concern over the planning, organization, and pace of South Africa's preparations. Others even expressed concerns over the safety of world cup visitors. In fact, South Africa has a high rate of criminality.

60,John kennedy,"John Fitzgerald Kennedy, born on May 29, 1917, was the 35th President of the United States, serving from January 1961 until he was assassinated in November 1963.
At the age of 43, he was the youngest to have been elected to the office, the second-youngest president (after Theodore Roosevelt), the first person born in the 20th century to serve as president. To date, Kennedy has been the only Catholic president and the only president to have won a Pulitzer Prize.
Events during his presidency included the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Space Race - by initiating Project Apollo (which would culminate in the moon landing), the building of the Berlin Wall, the African-American Civil Rights Movement, and increased U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.
Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas. Lee Harvey Oswald was accused of the crime and arrested that evening, but Jack Ruby shot and killed him two days later, before a trial could take place. The FBI and the Warren Commission officially concluded that Oswald was the lone assassin. However, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) concluded that those investigations were flawed and that Kennedy was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy.
Since the 1960s, information concerning Kennedy's private life has come to light. Details of Kennedy's health problems with which he struggled have become better known, especially since the 1990s. Although initially kept secret from the general public, reports of Kennedy being unfaithful in marriage have garnered much press.

61,What is art,"Art refers to a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts. These artworks express the author's imaginative or technical skill. Art is intended to be appreciated for its beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art.
Art has had a great number of different functions throughout its history, making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept. This does not imply that the purpose of Art is ""vague"", but that it has had many unique, different reasons for being created.
Art can have a personal function, it is an expression of basic human instinct for harmony, balance, rhythm. Art at this level is not an action or an object, but an internal appreciation of balance and harmony (beauty), and therefore an aspect of being human beyond utility. Art also provides a way to experience one's self in relation to the universe. This experience may often come unmotivated, as one appreciates art, music or poetry.
On the other hand art may have a social function. At its simplest, art is a form of communication. It seeks to entertain and bring about a particular emotion or mood, for the purpose of relaxing or entertaining the viewer. Art may also be an expression of social protest, seeking to question aspects of society.
The oldest form of art are visual arts, which include creation of images or objects in fields including painting, sculpture, printmaking, photography, and other visual media. Architecture is often included as one of the visual arts; however, like the decorative arts, it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of use are essential, in a way that they usually are not in a painting, for example.
Music, theater, film, dance, and other performing arts, as well as literature and other media such as interactive media, are included in a broader definition of art or the arts.
Until the 17th century, art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences. In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or applied arts.
Art may be characterized in terms of mimesis (i.e. its representation of reality), expression, communication of emotion, or other qualities. During the Romantic period, art came to be seen as ""a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science"". Though the definition of what constitutes art is disputed and has changed over time, general descriptions mention an idea of imaginative or technical skill stemming from human agency and creation.
The nature of art, and related concepts such as creativity and interpretation, are explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics.",art refer diver rang human activ creat visual auditori perform artifact artwork express author imagin technic skill art intend appreci beauti emot power gener form activ includ product work art critic art studi histori art aesthet dissemin art art great number differ function throughout histori make purpos difficult abstract quantifi singl concept impli purpos art vagu mani uniqu differ reason creat art person function express basic human instinct harmoni balanc rhythm art level action object intern appreci balanc harmoni beauti therefor aspect human beyond util art also provid way experi one self relat univers experi may often come unmotiv one appreci art music poetri hand art may social function simplest art form commun seek entertain bring particular emot mood purpos relax entertain viewer art may also express social protest seek question aspect societi oldest form art visual art includ creation imag object field includ paint sculptur printmak photographi visual medium architectur often includ one visual art howev like decor art involv creation object practic consider use essenti way usual paint exampl music theater film danc perform art well literatur medium interact medium includ broader definit art art centuri art refer skill masteri differenti craft scienc modern usag centuri aesthet consider paramount fine art separ distinguish acquir skill gener decor appli art art may character term mimesi represent realiti express commun emot qualiti romant period art came seen special faculti human mind classifi religion scienc though definit constitut art disput chang time gener descript mention idea imagin technic skill stem human agenc creation natur art relat concept creativ interpret explor branch philosophi known aesthet,C2
62,Ozone layer depletion,"The ozone layer depletion is harmful to the environment. The ozone layer or ozone shield is a region of Earth's stratosphere that absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation. It was discovered in 1913 by the French physicists Charles Fabry and Henri Buisson. The ozone layer contains high concentrations of ozone in relation to other parts of the atmosphere.
A depletion of the ozone layer has been noticed since the late 1970s. In atmospheric regions over Antarctica, the ozone layer has become significantly thin, especially in spring season causing the formation of what is called ‘ozone hole’. The main cause of ozone depletion and the ozone hole is man-made chemicals such as the chlorofluorocarbon (CFCs). As a consequence of the deterioration of the ozone layer, large amounts of ultraviolet B rays reach the Earth, which can cause skin cancer and cataracts in humans and harm animals as well.
The harmful consequences of ozone deterioration paved the way to the adoption of the Montreal Protocol in 1987. This protocol bans the production of CFCs, halons, and other ozone-depleting chemicals. The ban came into effect in 1989 and since then it has had positive effects on the environment. Ozone levels stabilized by the mid-1990s and began to recover in the 2000s.

63,Football soccer,"Football or soccer, which is considered to be the most popular sport in the world, is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players using a spherical ball.
The object of the game, which is played on a wide rectangular field with a goal on each end of the field, is to score by putting the ball into the adversary goal. The goal is kept by a goalkeeper who is allowed, at the exception of other players, to use his / her hands in the game. The winners are those who score the most goals. If the football (or soccer) match ends in a draw the two teams may be redirected to play extra time and / or penalty shootouts (each team taking turns to have a set number of kicks at the goal.)
The way football is played now was first codified in England. Nowadays, it is governed by the FIFA, ""Fédération Internationale de Football Association"" (International Federation of Association Football.) The game is played now all over the world and competitions are organized nationally, continentally and internationally. The most prestigious of football competitions is the World Cup, which is held every four years.",footbal soccer consid popular sport world team sport play two team eleven player use spheric ball object game play wide rectangular field goal end field score put ball adversari goal goal kept goalkeep allow except player use hand game winner score goal footbal soccer match end draw two team may redirect play extra time penalti shootout team take turn set number kick goal way footbal play first codifi england nowaday govern fifa fédération international de footbal associ intern feder associ footbal game play world competit organ nation continent intern prestigi footbal competit world cup held everi four year,B2
64,Easter day,"Easter Day is the central religious feast in the Christian world. According to Christian scripture, Jesus rose from the death on the third day after his crucifixion. Some Christians celebrate this resurrection on Easter Day or Easter Sunday (also Resurrection Day or Resurrection Sunday). Easter is a moveable feast, meaning it is not fixed in relation to the civil calendar.
According to the traditions, Easter Sunday is celebrated by taking part in an Easter vigil, lighting a new fire outside the church early on Sunday morning. Another custom involves lighting the Paschal candle and decorating it with studs to celebrate Christ's wounds. Chanting of the easter proclamation, reading the old testament, singing hymns and wishing happy Easter Day are other characteristics of the celebration.
Relatively newer elements such as the Easter Bunny and Easter egg hunts have become part of the holiday's modern celebrations, and those aspects are often celebrated by many Christians and non-Christians alike. The Easter Bunny, which is a counterpart to the Santa Claus of Christmas, brings gifts, a basket of colored eggs, to children on the night before the celebration. Easter eggs used to be painted chicken eggs, but a modern custom is to substitute chocolate eggs, or plastic eggs filled with confectionery such as jelly beans. These eggs are often hidden, allegedly by the Easter Bunny, for children to find on Easter morning.",easter day central religi feast christian world accord christian scriptur jesu rose death third day crucifixion christian celebr resurrect easter day easter sunday also resurrect day resurrect sunday easter moveabl feast mean fix relat civil calendar accord tradit easter sunday celebr take part easter vigil light new fire outsid church earli sunday morn anoth custom involv light paschal candl decor stud celebr christ wound chant easter proclam read old testament sing hymn wish happi easter day characterist celebr rel newer element easter bunni easter egg hunt becom part holiday modern celebr aspect often celebr mani christian alik easter bunni counterpart santa clau christma bring gift basket color egg child night celebr easter egg use paint chicken egg modern custom substitut chocol egg plastic egg fill confectioneri jelli bean egg often hidden allegedli easter bunni child find easter morn,B1
65,Stephen hawking biography,"Stephen William Hawking was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, author, and director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge. Hawking was born on January 8, 1942. At an early age, he showed an interest in science and technology. Although known at school as ""Einstein"", Hawking was not initially successful academically. With time, he began to show considerable aptitude for scientific subjects and decided to read mathematics at university. Hawking's father advised him to study medicine, concerned that there were few jobs for mathematics graduates.
At university, Hawking was diagnosed with motor neurone disease (also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ""ALS"" or Lou Gehrig's disease.) He fell into a depression – though his doctors advised that he continue with his studies, he felt there was little point. His disease progressed more slowly than doctors had predicted. Although Hawking had difficulty walking unsupported, and his speech was almost unintelligible, an initial diagnosis that he had only two years to live proved unfounded. With his Doctoral advisor's encouragement, he returned to his work. Hawking started developing a reputation for brilliance and brashness when he publicly challenged the work of the noted Yorkshire astronomer, Fred Hoyle, and his student Jayant Narlikar at a lecture in June 1964.
His scientific work included research on the origins and structure of the universe, from the Big Bang to black holes. He revolutionized the field by being the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.
Hawking was a fellow of the Royal Society (FRS), a lifetime member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States. In 2002, Hawking was ranked number 25 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. He was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge between 1979 and 2009 and achieved commercial success with works of popular science in which he discusses his own theories and cosmology in general. His book A Brief History of Time appeared on the British Sunday Times best-seller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks.
Hawking's illness gradually paralyzed him over the decades. However, even after the loss of his speech, he was still able to communicate through a speech-generating device, initially through the use of a hand-held switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle. He died on 14 March 2018 at the age of 76.",stephen william hawk english theoret physicist cosmologist author director research centr theoret cosmolog univers cambridg hawk born januari earli age show interest scienc technolog although known school einstein hawk initi success academ time began show consider aptitud scientif subject decid read mathemat univers hawk father advis studi medicin concern job mathemat graduat univers hawk diagnos motor neuron diseas also known amyotroph later sclerosi al lou gehrig diseas fell depress though doctor advis continu studi felt littl point diseas progress slowli doctor predict although hawk difficulti walk unsupport speech almost unintellig initi diagnosi two year live prove unfound doctor advisor encourag return work hawk start develop reput brillianc brash publicli challeng work note yorkshir astronom fred hoyl student jayant narlikar lectur june scientif work includ research origin structur univers big bang black hole revolution field first set theori cosmolog explain union gener theori rel quantum mechan vigor support interpret quantum mechan hawk fellow royal societi fr lifetim member pontif academi scienc recipi presidenti medal freedom highest civilian award unit state hawk rank number bbc poll greatest briton lucasian professor mathemat univers cambridg achiev commerci success work popular scienc discus theori cosmolog gener book brief histori time appear british sunday time list week hawk ill gradual paralyz decad howev even loss speech still abl commun devic initi use switch eventu use singl cheek muscl die march age,C1
66,World wide web,"The World Wide Web, the WWW or the Web refers to an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet. It was invented by the English scientist Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990. The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.
Web pages are primarily text documents formatted and annotated with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). In addition to formatted text, web pages may contain images, video, audio, and software components that are rendered in the user's web browser as coherent pages of multimedia content. Embedded hyperlinks permit users to navigate between web pages. Multiple web pages with a common domain name make up a website. Website content can largely be provided by the publisher or by users who contribute content online.
Recently, many people have criticized today's misuse of the web. The inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee himself has warned of the dangers of the Internet. According to him, the web has become a tool in the hand of the powerful to get what they want. For example, he warns that fake news is disseminated either to generate a lot of money or to attempt to manipulate people's opinions . Another worry was the gross invasion of privacy. Tim Berners-Lee is also concerned about governments' misuse of the Internet to collect personal data to manipulate or oppress people.",world wide web www web refer inform space document web resourc identifi uniform resourc locat url interlink hypertext link access via internet invent english scientist tim wrote first web browser comput program world wide web central develop inform age primari tool billion peopl use interact internet web page primarili text document format annot hypertext markup languag html addit format text web page may contain imag video audio softwar compon render user web browser coher page multimedia content embed hyperlink permit user navig web page multipl web page common domain name make websit websit content larg provid publish user contribut content onlin recent mani peopl critic today misus web inventor world wide web tim warn danger internet accord web becom tool hand power get want exampl warn fake news dissemin either gener lot money attempt manipul peopl opinion anoth worri gross invas privaci tim also concern govern misus internet collect person data manipul oppress peopl,B2
67,Martin luther king junior,"Martin Luther King, Jr. was an American clergyman, activist and prominent leader in the African-American Civil Rights Movement whose methods were similar to Mahathma Ghandhi's. He used nonviolent methods to fight for the advancement of civil rights in the USA.
Martin Luther King, Jr was born on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia. He was an excellent student and entered Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia, when he was only 15 years old. He has become a national icon in the history of modern American liberalism.
A Baptist minister, King became a civil rights activist early in his career. As a result of Rosa Parks refusal to leave her seat for a white passenger, King led the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott. He also helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in 1957, serving as its first president. King's efforts led to the 1963 March on Washington, where King delivered his ""I Have a Dream"" speech. There, he expanded American values to include the vision of a color blind society, and established his reputation as one of the greatest orators in American history.
In 1964, King became the youngest person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his work to end racial segregation and racial discrimination through civil disobedience and other nonviolent means. By the time of his death in 1968, he had refocused his efforts on ending poverty and stopping the Vietnam War. King was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee. He was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977 and Congressional Gold Medal in 2004; Martin Luther King, Jr. Day was established as a U.S. federal holiday in 1986.",martin luther king american clergyman activist promin leader civil right movement whose method similar mahathma ghandhi use nonviol method fight advanc civil right usa martin luther king jr born januari atlanta georgia excel student enter morehous colleg atlanta georgia year old becom nation icon histori modern american liber baptist minist king becam civil right activist earli career result rosa park refus leav seat white passeng king led montgomeri bu boycott also help found southern christian leadership confer sclc serv first presid king effort led march washington king deliv dream speech expand american valu includ vision color blind societi establish reput one greatest orat american histori king becam youngest person receiv nobel peac prize work end racial segreg racial discrimin civil disobedi nonviol mean time death refocus effort end poverti stop vietnam war king assassin april memphi tennesse posthum award presidenti medal freedom congression gold medal martin luther king day establish feder holiday,B2
68,International workers day,"The struggle to have eight hours for work, eight hours for recreation, and eight hours for rest was the origin of International Workers' Day, which is also referred to as May Day or Labor Day. The celebration commemorates the Haymarket Massacre in Chicago in 1886, when Chicago police shoot workers who were striking to establish the eight hour day. Many workers died in the event.
Historically, the first congress of the Second International, which was an organization of socialist and labor parties formed in Paris on July 14, 1889, called for international demonstrations on the 1890 anniversary of the Chicago protests. In 1891, the Second International recognized May Day as an annual event. In 1904, Social Democratic Party organizations and trade unions of all countries were called on to demonstrate actively on May First to establish eight hours of work a day and to get workers rights. Unions of all countries were urged to go on strike on May 1, wherever it is possible without injury to the workers.
Most countries celebrate International Workers' Day on May 1st, except in the United States and Canada, where Labor Day is held in September. Millions of working people and their labor unions, all over the world, organize street demonstrations and street marches. Several countries celebrate the day with parades, shows and other patriotic and labor-oriented events. Governments are urged to readjust salaries and wages and to acknowledge workers rights to strike and hold unions.",struggl eight hour work eight hour recreat eight hour rest origin intern worker day also refer may day labor day celebr commemor haymarket massacr chicago chicago polic shoot worker strike establish eight hour day mani worker die event histor first congress second intern organ socialist labor parti form pari juli call intern demonstr anniversari chicago protest second intern recogn may day annual event social democrat parti organ trade union countri call demonstr activ may first establish eight hour work day get worker right union countri urg go strike may wherev possibl without injuri worker countri celebr intern worker day may except unit state canada labor day held septemb million work peopl labor union world organ street demonstr street march sever countri celebr day parad show patriot event govern urg readjust salari wage acknowledg worker right strike hold union,C1
69,Alfred hitchcock,"Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock was born on the 13th of August, 1899. He was an English film director and producer. He is often referred to as the ""Master of Suspense"" because he was one of the first film makers to introduce the elements of the suspense and psychological thriller genres in cinema. He first started making successful silent films and early talkies in Britain and became renowned as England's best director. Then, Hitchcock moved to Hollywood in 1939, and became a U.S. citizen in 1955.
Hitchcock became a highly visible public figure through interviews, film trailers, and the ten years in which he hosted the television program Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955–1965). He also made brief appearances, technically called cameo appearances, in his own films. For example, he is seen struggling to get a double bass onto a train (Strangers on a Train), walking dogs out of a pet shop (The Birds), fixing a neighbour's clock (Rear Window), as a shadow (Family Plot), sitting at a table in a photograph (Dial M for Murder), and missing a bus (North by Northwest).

Hitchcock also created for himself a distinguishable directorial style. The term Hitchcockian is now often used to designate his style of film making. Hitchcock's stylistic trademarks include the use of camera movement that mimics a person's gaze, forcing viewers to engage in a form of voyeurism. In addition, he framed shots to maximize anxiety, fear, or empathy, and used innovative forms of film editing. His work often features fugitives on the run alongside ""icy blonde"" female characters. He often portrays characters with psychological problems. For instance, some of his films feature characters struggling in their relationships with their mothers.
Hitchcock is now recognized as one of the most influential directors in the the history of cinema. He directed more than fifty feature films in a career spanning six decades. His first thriller, The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog (1927), helped shape the thriller genre in film. His 1929 film, Blackmail, is often cited as the first British sound feature film, while Rear Window (1954), Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959) and Psycho (1960) are regularly ranked among the greatest films of all time.

70,Christmas shopping,"Develop your reading skills. Read the following text and do the comprehension questions
Christmas is generally a top-selling season for retailers in many countries around the world. Because it is a season where people buy gifts, decorations, and supplies to celebrate, sales escalate rapidly. In the U.S., the ""Christmas shopping season"" starts as early as October. In Canada, merchants begin advertising campaigns just before Halloween (October 31) and step up their marketing following Remembrance Day on November 11. In the UK and Ireland, the Christmas shopping season starts from mid-November, around the time when high street Christmas lights are turned on.
In the United States, it has been calculated that a quarter of all personal spending takes place during the Christmas/holiday shopping season. Statistics reveal that expenditure in department stores nationwide rose from $20.8 billion in November 2004 to $31.9 billion in December 2004, an increase of 54 percent. In other sectors, the pre-Christmas increase in spending was even greater. There was a November–December buying surge of 100 percent in bookstores and 170 percent in jewelry stores. In the same year employment in American retail stores rose from 1.6 million to 1.8 million in the two months leading up to Christmas. Industries completely dependent on Christmas include Christmas cards, of which 1.9 billion are sent in the United States each year, and live Christmas Trees, of which 20.8 million were cut in the U.S. in 2002. In the UK in 2010, up to £8 billion was expected to be spent online at Christmas, approximately a quarter of total retail festive sales.
The film industry also take the opportunity to make more money during the Chrismas holidays. Film studios release many high-budget movies during the holiday season, including Christmas films, fantasy movies or high-tone dramas with high production values hoping to maximize the chance of nominations for the Academy Awards.
In most Western nations, Christmas Day is the least active day of the year for business and commerce; almost all retail, commercial and institutional businesses are closed, and almost all industries cease activity (more than any other day of the year), whether laws require such or not. In England and Wales, the Christmas Day (Trading) Act 2004 prevents all large shops from trading on Christmas Day. Scotland is currently planning similar legislation.
Recently, many people have started protesting against the Christmas season consumerism. For example, Buy Nothing Christmas is an ongoing protest and reaction to the commercialization of the North American Christmas season. Contemporarily a movement was created to extend Adbusters magazine's Buy Nothing Day into the entire Christmas season. The idea advocated by this movement is that buying something never makes one happy. It is our human connections that are essential for our happiness. At a critical moment in human history when global warming is causing so much harm, this movement claims that it is wiser to ignore the advertisements that incite us to buy more, to buy things we do not really need.",develop read skill read follow text comprehens question christma gener season retail mani countri around world season peopl buy gift decor suppli celebr sale escal rapidli christma shop season start earli octob canada merchant begin advertis campaign halloween octob step market follow remembr day novemb uk ireland christma shop season start around time high street christma light turn unit state calcul quarter person spend take place shop season statist reveal expenditur depart store nationwid rose billion novemb billion decemb increas percent sector increas spend even greater buy surg percent bookstor percent jewelri store year employ american retail store rose million million two month lead christma industri complet depend christma includ christma card billion sent unit state year live christma tree million cut uk billion expect spent onlin christma approxim quarter total retail festiv sale film industri also take opportun make money chrisma holiday film studio releas mani movi holiday season includ christma film fantasi movi drama high product valu hope maxim chanc nomin academi award western nation christma day least activ day year busi commerc almost retail commerci institut busi close almost industri ceas activ day year whether law requir england wale christma day trade act prevent larg shop trade christma day scotland current plan similar legisl recent mani peopl start protest christma season consumer exampl buy noth christma ongo protest reaction commerci north american christma season contemporarili movement creat extend adbust magazin buy noth day entir christma season idea advoc movement buy someth never make one happi human connect essenti happi critic moment human histori global warm caus much harm movement claim wiser ignor advertis incit u buy buy thing realli need,C1
71,Slavery history,"Slavery is any system in which principles of property law are applied to people, allowing individuals to own, buy and sell other individuals. A slave is unable to withdraw unilaterally from such an arrangement and works without remuneration. In a broader sense, however, the word slavery may also refer to any situation in which an individual is de facto forced to work against their own will. Scholars also use more generic terms such as unfree labor or forced labor to refer to such situations. Slavery existed in many cultures, dating back to early human civilizations. A person could become enslaved from the time of their birth, capture, or purchase. Slavery was legal in most societies at some time in the past but is now outlawed in all recognized countries. The last country to officially abolish slavery was Mauritania in 1981. Nevertheless, there are an estimated 40.3 million people worldwide subject to some form of modern slavery. The most common form of the modern slave trade is commonly referred to as human trafficking.",slaveri system principl properti law appli peopl allow individu buy sell individu slave unabl withdraw unilater arrang work without remuner broader sen howev word slaveri may also refer situat individu de facto forc work scholar also use gener term unfre labor forc labor refer situat slaveri exist mani cultur date back earli human civil person could becom enslav time birth captur purchas slaveri legal societi time past outlaw recogn countri last countri offici abolish slaveri mauritania nevertheless estim million peopl worldwid subject form modern slaveri common form modern slave trade commonli refer human traffick,C1
72,History of pizza,"The modern pizza was originally invented in Naples, Italy but the word pizza is Greek in origin, derived from the Greek word pēktos meaning solid or clotted. The ancient Greeks covered their bread with oils, herbs and cheese. The first major innovation that led to flat bread pizza was the use of tomato as a topping. It was common for the poor of the area around Naples to add tomato to their yeast-based flat bread, and so the pizza began.
While it is difficult to say for sure who invented the pizza, it is however believed that modern pizza was first made by baker Raffaele Esposito of Naples. In fact, a popular urban legend holds that the archetypal pizza, Pizza Margherita, was invented in 1889, when the Royal Palace of Capodimonte commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three different pizzas he created, the Queen strongly preferred a pie swathed in the colors of the Italian flag: red (tomato), green (basil), and white (mozzarella). Supposedly, this kind of pizza was then named after the Queen as Pizza Margherita.
Later, the dish has become popular in many parts of the world!
Nowadays, many varieties of pizza exist worldwide, along with several dish variants based upon pizza.",modern pizza origin invent napl itali word pizza greek origin deriv greek word pēkto mean solid clot ancient greek cover bread oil herb chees first major innov led flat bread pizza use tomato top common poor area around napl add tomato flat bread pizza began difficult say sure invent pizza howev believ modern pizza first made baker raffael esposito napl fact popular urban legend hold archetyp pizza pizza margherita invent royal palac capodimont commiss neapolitan pizzaiolo raffael esposito creat pizza honor visit queen margherita three differ pizza creat queen strongli prefer pie swath color italian flag red tomato green basil white mozzarella supposedli kind pizza name queen pizza margherita later dish becom popular mani part world nowaday mani varieti pizza exist worldwid along sever dish variant base upon pizza,B1
73,Dolphin social behavior,"Dolphins are often regarded as one of Earth's most intelligent animals. They are social creatures, living in pods of up to a dozen individuals. In places with a high abundance of food, pods can merge temporarily, forming a superpod; such groupings may exceed 1,000 dolphins. They communicate using a variety of clicks, whistle-like sounds and other vocalizations.
Membership in pods is not rigid; interchange is common. Dolphins can, however, establish strong social bonds; they will stay with injured or ill individuals, even helping them to breathe by bringing them to the surface if needed. This altruism does not appear to be limited to their own species. The dolphin Moko in New Zealand has been observed guiding a female Pygmy Sperm Whale together with her calf out of shallow water where they had stranded several times. They have also been seen protecting swimmers from sharks by swimming circles around the swimmers or charging the sharks to make them go away.
Dolphins also display culture, something long believed to be unique to humans. In May 2005, a discovery in Australia found Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) teaching their young to use tools. They cover their snouts with sponges to protect them while foraging (looking or searching for food or provisions.) Using sponges as mouth protection as well as other transmitted behaviour proves dolphins' intelligence. This knowledge is mostly transferred by mothers to daughters.",dolphin often regard one earth intellig anim social creatur live pod dozen individu place high abund food pod merg temporarili form superpod group may exceed dolphin commun use varieti click sound vocal membership pod rigid interchang common dolphin howev establish strong social bond stay injur ill individu even help breath bring surfac need altruism appear limit speci dolphin moko new zealand observ guid femal pygmi sperm whale togeth calf shallow water strand sever time also seen protect swimmer shark swim circl around swimmer charg shark make go away dolphin also display cultur someth long believ uniqu human may discoveri australia found bottlenos dolphin tursiop aduncu teach young use tool cover snout spong protect forag look search food provis use spong mouth protect well transmit behaviour prove dolphin intellig knowledg mostli transfer mother daughter,B2
74,Christmas,"Christmas which is celebrated on December 25th is an important Christian holiday. The origin of the word ""Christmas"" comes from ""Christ"" and the ""Holy.Mass"" . It is believed that the day commemorates the birth of Jesus Christ although a lot of people doubt that the Day corresponds to the actual date of his birth. In spite of its Christian origin, Christmas is also celebrated by a lot of non Christian countries and the celebration includes a lot of non religious customs. People exchange gifts and greeting cards. Homes are decorated with Christmas trees, light and garlands. Dinners are planned with special food and all the families gather to have a lot of fun.
A central imaginary figure in Christmas is Father Christmas, also called Santa Claus. He is believed to fly on his sleigh bringing gifts for children .
Christmas is also an opportunity for economic growth. It has become an important period for business activity.

75,Economic recession,"Recession is a period of reduced economic activity. It is is a business cycle contraction typically characterized by a decline in GDP (Gross Domestic Product). Recession is generally accompanied by a drop in the stock market, an increase in unemployment, and a decline in the housing market.
By contrast, depression is a sustained, long-term downturn in economic activity in one or more economies. A depression is a more severe downturn than a recession, which is seen by some economists as part of the modern business cycle. The latter refers to fluctuations that occur around a long-term growth trend, and typically involve shifts over time between periods of relatively rapid economic growth (an expansion or boom), and periods of relative stagnation or decline (a contraction or recession)
During recessions, many macroeconomic indicators vary in a similar way. Production, as measured by gross domestic product, employment, investment spending, capacity utilization, household incomes, business profits, and inflation all fall, while bankruptcies and the unemployment rate rise.
Recessions generally occur when there is a widespread drop in spending, often following an adverse supply shock or the bursting of an economic bubble (also called speculative bubble). Governments usually respond to recessions by adopting expansionary macroeconomic policies, such as increasing money supply, increasing government spending and decreasing taxation.",recess period reduc econom activ busi cycl contract typic character declin gdp gross domest product recess gener accompani drop stock market increas unemploy declin hous market contrast depress sustain downturn econom activ one economi depress sever downturn recess seen economist part modern busi cycl latter refer fluctuat occur around growth trend typic involv shift time period rel rapid econom growth expans boom period rel stagnat declin contract recess recess mani macroeconom indic vari similar way product measur gross domest product employ invest spend capac util household incom busi profit inflat fall bankruptci unemploy rate rise recess gener occur widespread drop spend often follow advers suppli shock burst econom bubbl also call specul bubbl govern usual respond recess adopt expansionari macroeconom polici increas money suppli increas govern spend decreas taxat,B2

These, I, singing in spring, collect for lovers, (For who but I should understand lovers, and all their sorrow and joy? And who but I should be the poet of comrades?) Collecting, I traverse the garden, the world—but soon I pass the gates, Now along the pond-side—now wading in a little, fearing not the wet, Now by the post-and-rail fences, where the old stones thrown there, pick’d from the fields, have accumulated, Wild-flowers and vines and weeds come up through the stones, and partly cover them— Beyond these I pass, Far, far in the forest, before I think where I go, Solitary, smelling the earthy smell, stopping now and then in the silence, Alone I had thought—yet soon a silent troop gathers around me, Some walk by my side, and some behind, and some embrace my arms or neck, They, the spirits of friends, dead or alive—thicker they come, a great crowd, and I in the middle, Collecting, dispensing, singing in spring, there I wander with them, Plucking something for tokens—tossing toward whoever is near me; Here! lilac, with a branch of pine, Here out of my pocket, some moss which I pull’d off a live-oak in Florida, as it hung trailing down, Here, some pinks and laurel leaves, and a handful of sage, And here what I now draw from the water, wading in the pond-side, (O here I last saw him that tenderly loves me—and returns again, never to separate from me, And this, O this shall henceforth be the token of comrades—this Calamus-root shall, Interchange it, youths, with each other!

77,Seven interesting facts about christmas,"Christmas is one of the most important celebrations in Christian countries. It is a time when families gather, buy gifts for each other, and celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. There are, however, interesting facts about the celebration that few people know. So that you do not miss some essential information about Christmas, here are some facts about this holiday:
Christmas is observed on December 25th. It is a celebration commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, who is considered the son of God by Christians. The name is a combination of the words ""Christ"" and ""mass."" Mass refers to Christ's holy mass - a feast or festival celebrating Christ.
The birth of Jesus Christ is commemorated on December 25th every year. By contrast, many Orthodox Christians, mostly in Egypt and Russia, celebrate Jesus Christ's birth on January 7, due to different calendars.
It is, however, worthwhile noting that no one knows for sure when Jesus was born. Neither the bible nor the historical accounts provide exact information about Christ's date of birth.
Christmas was first celebrated in the Roman Empire in 336, during the reign of the Roman Emperor Constantine — thus technically, the Romans originated it, but no one person is credited with doing it.
Here are some interesting facts about other terms designating Christmas:
Today, Christmas is still connected to its religious background although it has gained some secular characteristics. For many people, Christmas is spending extra time with family, expressing thanks and love, sharing and making others happy, and commemorating the birth of the central figure of Christianity, Jesus Christ.
Christmas is also a worldwide cultural and economic phenomenon. It is considered the most significant economic boost for many countries worldwide since sales in practically all retail categories surge considerably. People buy and exchange gifts, decorate Christmas trees, enjoy meals with family and friends, and, of course, wait for Santa Claus to arrive.
St. Nicholas is the inspiration for Santa Claus. St. Nicholas, according to tradition, was a Christian bishop who helped the destitute and needy. He also adored youngsters and enjoyed discreetly giving them gifts. As his legend spread, he was nicknamed Sinterklaas. This has become Santa Claus subsequently.
Early modern Germany was the birthplace of contemporary Christmas trees during the Renaissance. It is frequently linked to Protestant Christian reformer Martin Luther, who is supposed to have first added lit candles on an evergreen tree in the 16th century.
In Christianity, the Christmas tree represents Jesus Christ's birth and resurrection.",christma one import celebr christian countri time famili gather buy gift celebr birth jesu christ howev interest fact celebr peopl know miss essenti inform christma fact holiday christma observ decemb celebr commemor birth jesu christ consid son god christian name combin word christ mass mass refer christ holi mass feast festiv celebr christ birth jesu christ commemor decemb everi year contrast mani orthodox christian mostli egypt russia celebr jesu christ birth januari due differ calendar howev worthwhil note one know sure jesu born neither bibl histor account provid exact inform christ date birth christma first celebr roman empir reign roman emperor constantin thu technic roman origin one person credit interest fact term design christma today christma still connect religi background although gain secular characterist mani peopl christma spend extra time famili express thank love share make other happi commemor birth central figur christian jesu christ christma also worldwid cultur econom phenomenon consid signific econom boost mani countri worldwid sinc sale practic retail categori surg consider peopl buy exchang gift decor christma tree enjoy meal famili friend cours wait santa clau arriv nichola inspir santa clau nichola accord tradit christian bishop help destitut needi also ador youngster enjoy discreetli give gift legend spread nicknam sinterklaa becom santa clau subsequ earli modern germani birthplac contemporari christma tree renaiss frequent link protest christian reform martin luther suppos first ad lit candl evergreen tree centuri christian christma tree repres jesu christ birth resurrect,B2

She held her father in great esteem. While hearing a church sermon about the newly recognized Mother's Day, Sonora felt strongly that fatherhood needed recognition as well. She approached the Spokane Ministerial Alliance and suggested her own father's birthday, of June 5, as the day of honor for fathers.

79,Mesothelioma,"Malignant mesothelioma is a rare form of cancer that develops from the protective lining that covers many of the body's internal organs, the mesothelium. It is usually caused by exposure to asbestos which is a set of six naturally occurring silicate minerals exploited commercially for their desirable physical properties.
Mesothelioma's most common site is the pleura (outer lining of the lungs and internal chest wall), but it may also occur in the peritoneum (the lining of the abdominal cavity), the pericardium (a sac that surrounds the heart), or the tunica vaginalis (a sac that surrounds the testis).
Most people who develop mesothelioma have worked on jobs where they inhaled asbestos, or they have been exposed to asbestos dust and fiber in other ways. It has also been suggested that washing the clothes of a family member who worked with asbestos can put a person at risk for developing mesothelioma. Unlike lung cancer, there is no association between mesothelioma and smoking, but smoking greatly increases the risk of other asbestos-induced cancers.
The symptoms of mesothelioma include shortness of breath due to pleural effusion (fluid between the lung and the chest wall) or chest wall pain, and general symptoms such as weight loss. The diagnosis may be suspected with chest X-ray and CT (X-ray computed tomography) scan, and is confirmed with a biopsy (tissue sample) and microscopic examination. A thoracoscopy (inserting a tube with a camera into the chest) can be used to take biopsies. It allows the introduction of substances such as talc to obliterate the pleural space (called pleurodesis), which prevents more fluid from accumulating and pressing on the lung. Despite treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy or sometimes surgery, the disease carries a poor prognosis. Research about screening tests for the early detection of mesothelioma is ongoing.",malign mesothelioma rare form cancer develop protect line cover mani bodi intern organ mesothelium usual caus exposur asbesto set six natur occur silic miner exploit commerci desir physic properti mesothelioma common site pleura outer line lung intern chest wall may also occur peritoneum line abdomin caviti pericardium sac surround heart tunica vaginali sac surround testi peopl develop mesothelioma work job inhal asbesto expo asbesto dust fiber way also suggest wash cloth famili member work asbesto put person risk develop mesothelioma unlik lung cancer associ mesothelioma smoke smoke greatli increas risk cancer symptom mesothelioma includ short breath due pleural effus fluid lung chest wall chest wall pain gener symptom weight loss diagnosi may suspect chest ct comput tomographi scan confirm biopsi tissu sampl microscop examin thoracoscopi insert tube camera chest use take biopsi allow introduct substanc talc obliter pleural space call pleurodesi prevent fluid accumul press lung despit treatment chemotherapi radiat therapi sometim surgeri diseas carri poor prognosi research screen test earli detect mesothelioma ongo,B2
80,To spring blake,"William Blake was an English poet, painter, and printmaker who lived from November 28, 1757, to August 12, 1827. Blake, who went mostly unnoticed during his lifetime, is now regarded as a pivotal figure in the history of Romantic poetry and visual art.
Although Blake's eccentric ideas caused him to be labeled as insane by his contemporaries, later reviewers praised him for his expressiveness and ingenuity, as well as the metaphysical and spiritual undercurrents in his work. His artwork and writings have been categorized as Romantic in nature.
Blake's poem ""To Spring"" - is taken from his collection Poetical Sketches, 1783.
This poem is divided into four stanzas, each with four lines. There is no rhyme pattern in it. The poem is in iambic pentameter.
The speaker in the poem - To Spring - is addressing the season of spring. The poet invites the seasons to come to his land.
Blake personifies spring as an angelic figure looking down from a window (similar to Juliet on the balcony looking down at Romeo). The earth is longing for this angel who is described as having “dewy locks,” “angel eyes,” “holy feet,” and “perfumed garments.” The speaker is asking for the angel spring to come down to earth and prepare to sow the seed of a new cycle. Blake is inviting the spring angel to “scatter thy pearls / upon our lovesick land” - ""our western isle"" (England.)
The speaker claims that spring is dawn, the new beginning. This poem has a hopeful tone. After the harshness of winter, there is a general optimism that fundamental unity and innocence would prevail over the oppressive power of experience.
O thou with dewy locks, who lookest down Through the clear windows of the morning, turn Thine angel eyes upon our western isle, Which in full choir hails thy approach, O Spring! The hills tell one another, and the listening Valleys hear; all our longing eyes are turn’d Up to thy bright pavilions: issue forth And let thy holy feet visit our clime! Come o’er the eastern hills, and let our winds Kiss thy perfumèd garments; let us taste Thy morn and evening breath; scatter thy pearls Upon our lovesick land that mourns for thee. O deck her forth with thy fair fingers; pour Thy soft kisses on her bosom; and put Thy golden crown upon her languish’d head, Whose modest tresses are bound up for thee.",william blake english poet painter printmak live novemb august blake went mostli unnot lifetim regard pivot figur histori romant poetri visual art although blake eccentr idea caus label insan contemporari later review prais express ingenu well metaphys spiritu undercurr work artwork write categor romant natur blake poem spring taken collect poetic sketch poem divid four stanza four line rhyme pattern poem iambic pentamet speaker poem spring address season spring poet invit season come land blake personifi spring angel figur look window similar juliet balconi look romeo earth long angel describ dewi lock angel eye holi foot perfum speaker ask angel spring come earth prepar sow seed new cycl blake invit spring angel scatter thi pearl upon lovesick land western isl england speaker claim spring dawn new begin poem hope tone harsh winter gener optim fundament uniti innoc would prevail oppress power experi thou dewi lock lookest clear window morn turn thine angel eye upon western isl full choir hail thi approach spring hill tell one anoth listen valley hear long eye turn thi bright pavilion issu forth let thi holi foot visit clime come er eastern hill let wind kiss thi perfumèd garment let u tast thi morn even breath scatter thi pearl upon lovesick land mourn thee deck forth thi fair finger pour thi soft kiss bosom put thi golden crown upon languish head whose modest tress bound thee,B1
81,Public debt,"Government debt refers to the money owed at any given time by any government. This may include public debt owed by the federal government, the state government, or the municipal and local government. Public debt increases when government spends more money than it collects in taxation. This leads to ""government deficit"" which refers to the difference between government receipts and spending in a single year, that is, the increase of debt over a particular year.
Government debt is also called public debt, national debt or sovereign debt. Government debt can be categorized as internal debt (owed to lenders within the country) and external debt (owed to foreign lenders). Another common division of government debt is by duration until repayment is due. Short term debt is generally considered to be for one year or less, long term is for more than ten years. Medium term debt falls between these two boundaries.
A broader definition of government debt considers all government liabilities, including future pension payments and payments for goods and services the government has contracted but not yet paid.",govern debt refer money owe given time govern may includ public debt owe feder govern state govern municip local govern public debt increas govern spend money collect taxat lead govern deficit refer differ govern receipt spend singl year increas debt particular year govern debt also call public debt nation debt sovereign debt govern debt categor intern debt owe lender within countri extern debt owe foreign lender anoth common divis govern debt durat repay due short term debt gener consid one year le long term ten year medium term debt fall two boundari broader definit govern debt consid govern liabil includ futur pension payment payment good servic govern contract yet paid,B1
82,Mother teresa,"Mother Teresa, was a Roman Catholic religious sister and missionary who lived most of her life in India. She was born on August 26, 1910 in today's Macedonia, with her family being of Albanian descent originating in Kosovo.
She was famous for founding the Missionaries of Charity, a Roman Catholic religious congregation, which in 2012 consisted of over 4,500 sisters and is active in 133 countries. Its mission was, in Mother Teresa's own words, to care for:
""the hungry, the naked, the homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society, people that have become a burden to the society and are shunned by everyone.""
Members the Missionaries of Charity must adhere to the vows of chastity, poverty and obedience as well as a fourth vow, to give ""wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor"".
Mother Teresa recieved numerous honours including the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize. In 2003, she was beatified as ""Blessed Teresa of Calcutta"". A second miracle credited to her intercession is required before she can be recognised as a saint by the Catholic Church.
She suffered a heart attack in Rome in 1983 while visiting Pope John Paul II. After a second attack in 1989, she received an artificial pacemaker. In 1991, after a battle with pneumonia while in Mexico, she suffered further heart problems. She offered to resign her position as head of the Missionaries of Charity, but the sisters of the congregation, in a secret ballot, voted for her to stay. Mother Teresa agreed to continue her work as head of the congregation. She died on September 5, 1997.",mother teresa roman cathol religi sister missionari live life india born august today macedonia famili albanian descent origin kosovo famou found missionari chariti roman cathol religi congreg consist sister activ countri mission mother teresa word care hungri nake homeless crippl blind leper peopl feel unwant unlov uncar throughout societi peopl becom burden societi shun everyon member missionari chariti must adher vow chastiti poverti obedi well fourth vow give wholeheart free servic poorest poor mother teresa reciev numer honour includ nobel peac prize beatifi bless teresa calcutta second miracl credit intercess requir recognis saint cathol church suffer heart attack rome visit pope john paul ii second attack receiv artifici pacemak battl pneumonia mexico suffer heart problem offer resign posit head missionari chariti sister congreg secret ballot vote stay mother teresa agre continu work head congreg die septemb,B2
83,Brain drain,"Brain drain, which is the action of having highly skilled and educated people leaving their country to work abroad, has become one of the developing countries concern. Brain drain is also referred to as human capital flight. More and more third world science and technology educated people are heading for more prosperous countries seeking higher wages and better working conditions. This has of course serious consequences on the sending countries.
While many people believe that immigration is a personal choice that must be understood and respected, others look at the phenomenon from a different perspective. What makes those educated people leave their countries should be seriously considered and a distinction between push and pull factors must be made. The push factors include low wages and lack of satisfactory working and living conditions. Social unrest, political conflicts and wars may also be determining causes. The pull factors, however, include intellectual freedom and substantial funds for research.
Brain drain has negative impact on the sending countries economic prospects and competitiveness. It reduces the number of dynamic and creative people who can contribute to the development of their country. Likewise, with more entrepreneurs taking their investments abroad, developing countries are missing an opportunity of wealth creation. This has also negative consequences on tax revenue and employment.
Most of the measures taken so far have not had any success in alleviating the effects of brain drain. A more global view must take into consideration the provision of adequate working and living conditions in the sending countries. An other option should involve encouraging the expatriates to contribute their skill to the development of their countries without necessarily physically relocating.",brain drain action highli skill educ peopl leav countri work abroad becom one develop countri concern brain drain also refer human capit flight third world scienc technolog educ peopl head prosper countri seek higher wage better work condit cours seriou consequ send countri mani peopl believ immigr person choic must understood respect other look phenomenon differ perspect make educ peopl leav countri serious consid distinct push pull factor must made push factor includ low wage lack satisfactori work live condit social unrest polit conflict war may also determin caus pull factor howev includ intellectu freedom substanti fund research brain drain neg impact send countri econom prospect competit reduc number dynam creativ peopl contribut develop countri likewis entrepreneur take invest abroad develop countri miss opportun wealth creation also neg consequ tax revenu employ measur taken far success allevi effect brain drain global view must take consider provis adequ work live condit send countri option involv encourag expatri contribut skill develop countri without necessarili physic reloc,C1
84,Santa claus,"Santa Claus, also known as Saint Nicholas, Father Christmas, Kris Kringle, or simply ""Santa"", is a figure which was derived from the Dutch figure of Sinterklaas, a historical, legendary and mythological figure who in many Western cultures, is said to bring gifts to the homes of the good children during the late evening and overnight hours of Christmas Eve, December 24 or on his Feast Day, December 6 (Saint Nicholas Day).The legend is based on the tales concerning the historical figure of gift giver Saint Nicholas.
While Saint Nicholas was originally portrayed wearing bishop's robes, today Santa Claus is generally depicted as a plump, jolly, white-bearded man wearing a red coat with white collar and cuffs, white-cuffed red trousers, and black leather belt and boots (images of him rarely have a beard with no mustache). This image became popular in the United States and Canada in the 19th century due to the significant influence of caricaturist and political cartoonist Thomas Nast. This image has been maintained and reinforced through song, radio, television, and films. In the United Kingdom and Europe, he is often depicted in a manner identical to the American Santa Claus, but he is commonly called Father Christmas.",santa clau also known saint nichola father christma kri kringl simpli santa figur deriv dutch figur sinterklaa histor legendari mytholog figur mani western cultur said bring gift home good child late even overnight hour christma eve decemb feast day decemb saint nichola day legend base tale concern histor figur gift giver saint nichola saint nichola origin portray wear bishop robe today santa clau gener depict plump jolli man wear red coat white collar cuff red trouser black leather belt boot imag rare beard mustach imag becam popular unit state canada centuri due signific influenc caricaturist polit cartoonist thoma nast imag maintain reinforc song radio televis film unit kingdom europ often depict manner ident american santa clau commonli call father christma,B2

86,Humour,"Humor, the tendency of particular cognitive experiences to provoke laughter and provide amusement, affects how we perceive and respond to life. It enhances the quality of life and may relieve the body from so many health problems. In fact, humans are the only creatures on earth that are endowed with the ability to laugh.
The difference between humor and laughter is that humor is a perceptual process while laughter is a behavioral response. People of all ages and cultures respond to humor. The majority of people are able to experience humor, i.e., to be amused, to laugh or smile at something funny, and thus they are considered to have a sense of humor. The hypothetical person lacking a sense of humor would likely find the behavior induced by humor to be inexplicable, strange, or even irrational. Though ultimately decided by personal taste, the extent to which a person will find something humorous depends upon a host of variables, including geographical location, culture, maturity, level of education, intelligence and context.
Regular laughter sessions can have important effects on our health and well being. For instance, laughter is considered to be a stress buster and researchers found a direct link between laughter and healthy function of blood vessels. Laughter causes the dilatation of the inner lining of blood vessels, the endothelium, and increases blood flow. It also has been shown to lead to reductions in stress hormones such as cortisol and epinephrine. When laughing the brain also releases endorphins that can relieve some physical pain. Laughter also boosts the number of antibody-producing cells and enhances the effectiveness of T-cells, a type of cells that lead to a stronger immune system.
Since laughter does effect the body, mind and spirit the only thing you have to do to lead a happy life is LAUGH, as simple as that.",humor tendenc particular cognit experi provok laughter provid amus affect perceiv respond life enhanc qualiti life may reliev bodi mani health problem fact human creatur earth endow abil laugh differ humor laughter humor perceptu process laughter behavior respons peopl age cultur respond humor major peopl abl experi humor amus laugh smile someth funni thu consid sen humor hypothet person lack sen humor would like find behavior induc humor inexplic strang even irrat though ultim decid person tast extent person find someth humor depend upon host variabl includ geograph locat cultur matur level educ intellig context regular laughter session import effect health well instanc laughter consid stress buster research found direct link laughter healthi function blood vessel laughter caus dilat inner line blood vessel endothelium increas blood flow also shown lead reduct stress hormon cortisol epinephrin laugh brain also releas endorphin reliev physic pain laughter also boost number cell enhanc effect type cell lead stronger immun system sinc laughter effect bodi mind spirit thing lead happi life laugh simpl,B2
87,Apartheid south africa,"Apartheid was a system of racial segregation enforced through legislation by the National Party (NP) governments of South Africa. In this system, which lasted from 1948 to 1994, the rights of the majority black inhabitants of South Africa were curtailed and white supremacy and Afrikaner minority rule was maintained. South West Africans were also victims of apartheid as this country was administered by South Africa under a League of Nations mandate until it gained independence as Namibia in 1990.
Apartheid as an official policy was introduced following the general election of 1948. New legislation classified inhabitants into four racial groups (""native"", ""white"", ""coloured"", and ""Asian""), and residential areas were segregated, sometimes by means of forced removals. Non-white political representation was completely abolished in 1970, and starting in that year black people were deprived of their citizenship. The government segregated education, medical care, beaches, and other public services, and provided black people with services inferior to those of white people.
Apartheid sparked significant internal resistance and violence as well as a long arms and trade embargo against South Africa. In addition to the unrest resulting from the internal protests, the sanctions placed on South Africa by the West made it increasingly difficult for the government to maintain the regime. In 1990 President Frederik Willem de Klerk began negotiations to end apartheid, culminating in multi-racial democratic elections in 1994, which were won by the African National Congress under Nelson Mandela.",apartheid system racial segreg enforc legisl nation parti np govern south africa system last right major black inhabit south africa curtail white supremaci afrikan minor rule maintain south west african also victim apartheid countri administ south africa leagu nation mandat gain independ namibia apartheid offici polici introduc follow gener elect new legisl classifi inhabit four racial group nativ white colour asian residenti area segreg sometim mean forc remov polit represent complet abolish start year black peopl depriv citizenship govern segreg educ medic care beach public servic provid black peopl servic inferior white peopl apartheid spark signific intern resist violenc well long arm trade embargo south africa addit unrest result intern protest sanction place south africa west made increasingli difficult govern maintain regim presid frederik willem de klerk began negoti end apartheid culmin democrat elect african nation congress nelson mandela,B2
88,The alchemist by paulo coelho,"The Alchemist by the Brazilian author Paulo Coelho is one of the best-selling books in history. It was first published in 1988 in Portuguese and is now translated internationally into many languages. The novel is an allegory that follows a young Andalusian shepherd in his journey to the pyramids of Egypt, after having a recurring dream of finding a treasure there. Coelho wrote The Alchemist in only two weeks in 1987. He explained that he was able to write at this pace because the story was ""already written in [his] soul.""
The story starts with a description of a shepherd named Santiago arriving with his flock at an abandoned Church. Santiago keeps dreaming about a treasure that he discovers near the pyramids in Egypt. A fortune teller interprets the dream as a prophecy. Before he starts the journey, Santiago meets an old king named Melchizedek, or the king of Salem, who tells him to sell his sheep, so as to travel to Egypt, and introduces the idea of a Personal Legend. Your Personal Legend ""is what you have always wanted to accomplish. Everyone, when they are young, knows what their Personal Legend is."" Subsequently, the book's plot largely focuses on Santiago following his dream and trying to live out his Personal Legend. He embarks on a journey to Tangiers and then to Egypt where he had to face so many obstacles before he discovers his treasure.
The book's main theme is about finding one's destiny, although according to The New York Times, The Alchemist is ""more self-help than literature."" The advice that was given to Santiago (""when you really want something to happen, the whole universe will conspire so that your wish comes true"") is the core of the novel's philosophy and a motif that plays throughout it. Another interesting theme in the novel and that one can relate to is those related to the detrimental consequences of fear. If people let fear control their lives, they will live miserably. Had Santiago let the fear from following his dream dominate his life, he wouldn't have discovered the treasure and most importantly the meaning of his life, his Personal Legend.",alchemist brazilian author paulo coelho one book histori first publish portugues translat intern mani languag novel allegori follow young andalusian shepherd journey pyramid egypt recur dream find treasur coelho wrote alchemist two week explain abl write pace stori alreadi written soul stori start descript shepherd name santiago arriv flock abandon church santiago keep dream treasur discov near pyramid egypt fortun teller interpret dream propheci start journey santiago meet old king name melchizedek king salem tell sell sheep travel egypt introduc idea person legend person legend alway want accomplish everyon young know person legend subsequ book plot larg focus santiago follow dream tri live person legend embark journey tangier egypt face mani obstacl discov treasur book main theme find one destini although accord new york time alchemist literatur advic given santiago realli want someth happen whole univers conspir wish come true core novel philosophi motif play throughout anoth interest theme novel one relat relat detriment consequ fear peopl let fear control live live miser santiago let fear follow dream domin life would discov treasur importantli mean life person legend,B2
89,William shakespeare short biography,"William Shakespeare was an English poet, playwright, and actor. He was born on 26 April 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon. His father was a successful local businessman and his mother was the daughter of a landowner. Shakespeare is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and nicknamed the Bard of Avon. He wrote about 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, of which the authorship of some is uncertain. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.
Shakespeare married Anne Hathaway at the age of 18. She was eight years older than him. They had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. After his marriage information about his life became very rare. But he is thought to have spent most of his time in London writing and performing in his plays. Between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men.
Around 1613, at the age of 49, he retired to Stratford , where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive. He died on 23 April 1616, at the age of 52. He died within a month of signing his will, a document which he begins by describing himself as being in ""perfect health"". In his will, Shakespeare left the bulk of his large estate to his elder daughter Susanna.
Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were mainly comedies and histories and these works remain regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, including Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, considered some of the finest works in the English language. In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as romances, and collaborated with other playwrights.
Shakespeare's plays remain highly popular today and are constantly studied, performed, and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world.",william shakespear english poet playwright actor born april father success local businessman mother daughter landown shakespear wide regard greatest writer english languag world dramatist often call england nation poet nicknam bard avon wrote play sonnet two long narr poem vers authorship uncertain play translat everi major live languag perform often playwright shakespear marri ann hathaway age eight year older three child susanna twin hamnet judith marriag inform life becam rare thought spent time london write perform play began success career london actor writer play compani call lord chamberlain men later known king men around age retir stratford die three year later record shakespear privat life surviv die april age die within month sign document begin describ perfect health shakespear left bulk larg estat elder daughter susanna shakespear produc known work earli play mainli comedi histori work remain regard best work produc genr wrote mainli tragedi includ hamlet othello king lear macbeth consid finest work english languag last phase wrote tragicomedi also known romanc collabor playwright shakespear play remain highli popular today constantli studi perform reinterpret diver cultur polit context throughout world,B2
90,I have a dream,"""I Have a Dream"" is a very eloquent speech by Martin Luther King Jr. It is a 17-minute public speech delivered on August 28, 1963, in which King called for racial equality and an end to discrimination. The speech, from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, was a defining moment of the American Civil Rights Movement. Delivered to over 200,000 civil rights supporters, the speech was ranked the top American speech of the 20th century by a 1999 poll of scholars of public address.
Here is an extract of the speech:
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.""
I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.

91,Pablo picasso,"Pablo Picasso is considered to be one of the most famous painters in the twentieth century. He was born in Malaga, Spain on October 20, 1881. In addition to painting, Picasso was also a printmaker, ceramicist, stage designer, poet and playwright. He spent most of his adult life in France.
Picasso showed a passion and a skill for drawing from an early age. According to his mother, his first words were ""piz, piz"", a shortening of lápiz, the Spanish word for ""pencil"". From the age of seven, Picasso received formal artistic training from his father in figure drawing and oil painting. On one occasion, the father found his son painting over his unfinished sketch of a pigeon. Observing the precision of his son's technique, the father felt that the thirteen-year-old Picasso had surpassed him, and vowed to give up painting.
Picasso grew up to become one of the greatest and most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Picasso is now regarded as one of the artists who most defined the revolutionary developments in the plastic arts in the opening decades of the 20th century
Picasso had affairs with a lot of women and was married twice and had four children, Paulo, Maya, Claude and Paloma by three women. He died on 8 April 1973 in Mougins, France, while he and his wife Jacqueline entertained friends for dinner. He was interred at the Chateau of Vauvenargues near Aix-en-Provence, a property he had acquired in 1958 and occupied with Jacqueline between 1959 and 1962. Jacqueline Roque prevented his children Claude and Paloma from attending the funeral. Devastated and lonely after the death of Picasso, Jacqueline Roque killed herself by gunshot in 1986 when she was 59 years old.",pablo picasso consid one famou painter twentieth centuri born malaga spain octob addit paint picasso also printmak ceramicist stage design poet playwright spent adult life franc picasso show passion skill draw earli age accord mother first word piz piz shorten lápiz spanish word pencil age seven picasso receiv formal artist train father figur draw oil paint one occas father found son paint unfinish sketch pigeon observ precis son techniqu father felt picasso surpass vow give paint picasso grew becom one greatest influenti artist centuri known cubist movement invent construct sculptur collag wide varieti style help develop explor picasso regard one artist defin revolutionari develop plastic art open decad centuri picasso affair lot woman marri twice four child paulo maya claud paloma three woman die april mougin franc wife jacquelin entertain friend dinner inter chateau vauvenargu near properti acquir occupi jacquelin jacquelin roqu prevent child claud paloma attend funer devast lone death picasso jacquelin roqu kill gunshot year old,B2
92,Mothers day,"The modern Mother's Day is celebrated on various days in many parts of the world, most commonly in March, April, or May as a day to honor mothers and motherhood. In the UK and Ireland, it follows the old traditions of Mothering Sunday, celebrated in March/April.
Historically, the celebration has it origin in ancient customs and traditions. The ancient Greeks kept a festival to Cybele, a great mother of Greek gods. The ancient Romans also had another holiday, Matronalia, that was dedicated to Juno (an ancient Roman goddess), though mothers were usually given gifts on this day. In Europe there were several long standing traditions where a specific Sunday was set aside to honor motherhood and mothers such as Mothering Sunday which is a Christian festival celebrated throughout Europe that falls on the 4th Sunday in Lent. One of the early calls to celebrate Mother's Day in the United States was the ""Mother's Day Proclamation"" by Julia Ward Howe. Written in 1870, the Proclamation was tied to Howe's feminist belief that women had a responsibility to shape their societies at the political level.
Today the holiday has become very popular around the world. People take the day as an opportunity to pay tribute to their mothers and thank them for all their love and support. There is also a tradition of gifting flowers, cards and other gift to mothers on the occasion.",modern mother day celebr variou day mani part world commonli march april may day honor mother motherhood uk ireland follow old tradit mother sunday celebr histor celebr origin ancient custom tradit ancient greek kept festiv cybel great mother greek god ancient roman also anoth holiday matronalia dedic juno ancient roman goddess though mother usual given gift day europ sever long stand tradit specif sunday set asid honor motherhood mother mother sunday christian festiv celebr throughout europ fall sunday lent one earli call celebr mother day unit state mother day proclam julia ward howe written proclam tie howe feminist belief woman respons shape societi polit level today holiday becom popular around world peopl take day opportun pay tribut mother thank love support also tradit gift flower card gift mother occas,B2
93,Sustainable development,"The best definition of Sustainable development was presented by the report Our Common Future (also known as the Brundtland Report):
""Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.""
Sustainable development is thus the ability to meet the needs of the present while contributing to the future generations’ needs. It focuses on two goals:
Green development is generally differentiated from sustainable development in that Green development prioritizes what its proponents consider to be environmental sustainability over economic and cultural considerations. In addition to that, sustainable development has underlying concepts: the concept of 'needs', in particular the essential needs of the world's poor, to which overriding priority should be given; and the idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment's ability to meet present and future needs. There is an additional focus on the present generations' responsibility to improve the future generations' life by restoring the previous ecosystem damage and resisting to contribute to further ecosystem damage.
Sustainable development requires action on the part of world states, governments and people. The detrimental situation of the environment, the enormous stress upon our natural resources and the huge gap between developed and underdeveloped countries, necessitate practical strategies to reverse the trends. The World Commission on Environment and Development suggested seven critical objectives for environment and development policies that follow from the concept of sustainable development:
These recommendations are still valid; not to do things differently is dangerous and condemnable. Slow actions would be detrimental.",best definit sustain develop present report common futur also known brundtland report sustain develop develop meet need present without compromis abil futur gener meet need sustain develop thu abil meet need present contribut futur gener need focus two goal green develop gener differenti sustain develop green develop priorit propon consid environment sustain econom cultur consider addit sustain develop underli concept concept particular essenti need world poor overrid prioriti given idea limit impos state technolog social organ environ abil meet present futur need addit focu present gener respons improv futur gener life restor previou ecosystem damag resist contribut ecosystem damag sustain develop requir action part world state govern peopl detriment situat environ enorm stress upon natur resourc huge gap develop underdevelop countri necessit practic strategi revers trend world commiss environ develop suggest seven critic object environ develop polici follow concept sustain develop recommend still valid thing differ danger condemn slow action would detriment,C2
94,List nobel prize laureates,"The Nobel Prizes are awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Swedish Academy, the Karolinska Institute, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee to individuals and organizations who make outstanding contributions in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. They were established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, which dictates that the awards should be administered by the Nobel Foundation.
As of 2008, 789 individuals and 20 organizations have been awarded a Nobel Prize, including 62 winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. Four Nobel laureates were not permitted by their governments to accept the Nobel Prize. Adolf Hitler forbade three Germans, Richard Kuhn (Chemistry, 1938), Adolf Butenandt (Chemistry, 1939), and Gerhard Domagk (Physiology or Medicine, 1939), from accepting their Nobel Prizes, and the government of the Soviet Union pressured Boris Pasternak (Literature, 1958) to decline his award. Two Nobel laureates, Jean-Paul Sartre (Literature, 1964) and Lê Ðức Thọ (Peace, 1973), declined the award; Sartre declined the award as he declined all official honors, and Lê declined the award due to the situation Vietnam was in at the time. Six laureates have received more than one prize; of the six, the International Committee of the Red Cross has received the Nobel Peace Prize three times, more than any other. Among the 809 Nobel Laureates, 35 Nobel laureates have been women; the first woman to win a Nobel Prize was Marie Curie, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903. In years in which the Nobel Prize is not awarded due to external events or a lack of nominations, the prize money is returned to the funds delegated to the relevant prize. The Nobel Prize was not awarded between 1940 and 1942 due to the outbreak of World War II.

95,April fool day,"April Fools Day, sometimes called All Fool's Day, is on the first of April every year. People can play practical jokes. That's why you shouldn't believe what is said to you and you should be doubtful of the people around you on this day. Someone might change the time on another person's alarm to make him wake up very early or very late. Or she / he may put a lot of pepper in another's food. Of course all this is done just for fun. when the trick is played people say ""April Fool"" to make the poor person realize that it was just a joke.
Some of the well known and most successful pranks or practical jokes were on the media - television, radio stations, newspapers... For instance, a BBC television program ran a famous hoax in 1957, showing Italians harvesting spaghetti from trees. A large number of people contacted the BBC wanting to know how to cultivate spaghetti trees. In 2008, the BBC again reported on a newly discovered colony of flying penguins showing people walking with the penguins in Antarctica, and following their flight to the Amazon rainforest.",april fool day sometim call fool day first april everi year peopl play practic joke believ said doubt peopl around day someon might chang time anoth person alarm make wake earli late may put lot pepper anoth food cours done fun trick play peopl say april fool make poor person realiz joke well known success prank practic joke medium televis radio station newspap instanc bbc televis program ran famou hoax show italian harvest spaghetti tree larg number peopl contact bbc want know cultiv spaghetti tree bbc report newli discov coloni fli penguin show peopl walk penguin antarctica follow flight amazon rainforest,B1
96,Arab uprisings,"The series of protests and demonstrations which started in 2011 across the Middle East and North Africa has become known as the ""Arab Spring"", and sometimes as the ""Arab Spring and Winter"", ""Arab Awakening"" or ""Arab Uprisings"". It was sparked by the first protests that occurred in Tunisia on 18 December 2010 following Mohamed Bouazizi's self-immolation in protest of police corruption and ill treatment.
With the success of the protests in Tunisia, a wave of unrest struck several Arab countries. Egypt was the next country where protesters succeeded in overthrowing the regime of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. In August 2011, rebels in Libya succeeded in liberating the Libyan capital, Tripoli and ending the regime of Muammar Gaddafi with the help of the NATO strikes. Other Arab countries such as Yemen, Syria, Bahrain and Algeria have also been subject to much turmoil. Protesters demand more democracy, corruption crackdown and better living conditions for everybody. The most organized demonstrations often occur on a ""day of rage"", usually Friday after noon prayers. The protests have also triggered similar unrest outside the region.",seri protest demonstr start across middl east north africa becom known arab spring sometim arab spring winter arab awaken arab upris spark first protest occur tunisia decemb follow moham bouazizi protest polic corrupt ill treatment success protest tunisia wave unrest struck sever arab countri egypt next countri protest succeed overthrow regim egyptian presid hosni mubarak august rebel libya succeed liber libyan capit tripoli end regim muammar gaddafi help nato strike arab countri yemen syria bahrain algeria also subject much turmoil protest demand democraci corrupt crackdown better live condit everybodi organ demonstr often occur day rage usual friday noon prayer protest also trigger similar unrest outsid region,B2
97,Oscar awards,"The Academy Awards, informally known as The Oscars, are a set of awards given annually for excellence of cinematic achievements. The Oscar statuette is officially named the Academy Award of Merit and is one of nine types of Academy Awards. Organized and overseen by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), the awards are given each year at a formal ceremony.
The awards were first given in 1929 at a ceremony created for the awards, at the Hotel Roosevelt in Hollywood. Over the years that the award has been given, the categories presented have changed; currently Oscars are given in more than a dozen categories, and include films of various types. As one of the most prominent award ceremonies in the world, the Academy Awards ceremony is televised live in more than 100 countries annually. It is also the oldest award ceremony in the media.
While the Oscar is under the ownership of the recipient, it is essentially not on the open market. Since 1950, the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the Academy for US$1. If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation, then the Academy keeps the statuette. Academy Awards not protected by this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six-figure sums.",academi award inform known oscar set award given annual excel cinemat achiev oscar statuett offici name academi award merit one nine type academi award organ overseen academi motion pictur art scienc ampa award given year formal ceremoni award first given ceremoni creat award hotel roosevelt hollywood year award given categori present chang current oscar given dozen categori includ film variou type one promin award ceremoni world academi award ceremoni televis live countri annual also oldest award ceremoni medium oscar ownership recipi essenti open market sinc statuett legal encumb requir neither winner heir may sell statuett without first offer sell back academi u winner refus agre stipul academi keep statuett academi award protect agreement sold public auction privat deal sum,B2
98,Nobel prize obama,"The 2009 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to U.S. President Barack Obama ""for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples."" The award was announced on October 9, 2009. As specific examples of the work that led to the award, the Committee highlighted efforts to promote nuclear nonproliferation, and a ""new climate"" in international relations fostered by Obama, especially in reaching out to the Muslim world. Obama is third sitting U.S. President to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and the third African American. He received the prize eight and a half months after his inauguration.
The White House announced Obama would travel to Oslo in December to accept the prize. Obama plans to donate the full 10 million Swedish kronor (US$1.4 million) monetary award to charity.
Initial reaction to the award was mixed. Among Nobel laureates, former U.S. Vice President Al Gore called the award ""extremely well deserved"", whereas former President of Poland Lech Wałęsa, who received the prize in 1983, said: ""So soon? This is too soon. He has not yet made a real input.""
Jagland, the chairman of the Nobel Committee, said he hoped the award would assist Obama's foreign policy efforts. He added: ""We have not given the prize for what may happen in the future. We are awarding Obama for what he has done in the past year. And we are hoping this may contribute a little bit for what he is trying to do."" Jagland said the committee was influenced by a speech Obama gave about Islam in Cairo in June 2009, as well as the president's efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation and climate change, as well as Obama's support for using established international bodies such as the United Nations to pursue foreign policy goals.
Obama is the third sitting U.S. President to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, the others being: Theodore Roosevelt (1906) and Woodrow Wilson (1919). Former President Jimmy Carter (2002) received the award after leaving office. In addition, the then sitting Vice President Charles Dawes was a co-winner with Austen Chamberlain (1925), and former Vice President Al Gore was a co-winner with the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2007). Obama is the third African American to win this honor, the others being: Ralph J. Bunche, (1950) and Martin Luther King, Jr., (1964).
Obama said he was ""surprised"" and ""deeply humbled"" by the award. He stated that he does not feel he deserved the award,saying that he did not feel worthy of the company the award would place him in. In remarks given at the White House Rose Garden on the day of the announcement, Obama stated, ""I do not view it as a recognition of my own accomplishments but rather an affirmation of American leadership on behalf of aspirations held by people in all nations.""
The award drew initial criticism that it was undeserved or premature due to a perceived lack of significant accomplishments on Obama's part so far and his role in conflicts abroad. However, opinions were divided.There was widespread criticism of the Nobel Committee's decision from commentators and editorial writers across the political spectrum. Today host Matt Lauer said, “We’re less than a year into the first term of this president and there are no—I'm not trying to be, you know, rude here—no major foreign policy achievements, to date."" Peter Beinart of the Daily Beast called the decision a ""farce"", said, ""(Obama)'s done nothing to deserve the prize."" Jonah Goldberg of the National Review said, ""surely someone in Iran—or maybe the Iranian protestors generally—could have benefitted more from receiving the prize than a president who, so far, has done virtually nothing concrete for world peace.""
Welcoming reactions came from Europe. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said the award would reinforce Obama's determination to work for justice and peace. He added that the award ""finally confirms the return of America in the hearts of all the peoples of the world"". Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said the award will encourage warmer U.S.–Russian relations, and he hoped it would ""serve as an additional incentive"" for both governments to foster a better ""climate in world politics"". British Prime Minister Gordon Brown sent a private message of congratulations to President Obama. Hope that the prize would assist Obama's efforts toward nuclear disarmament was also a part of congratulatory statements from Ireland's Taoiseach Brian Cowen and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Vatican spokesman Fr. Federico Lombardi said the Vatican ""appreciated"" the nomination.",nobel peac prize award presid barack obama extraordinari effort strengthen intern diplomaci cooper peopl award announc octob specif exampl work led award committe highlight effort promot nuclear nonprolifer new climat intern relat foster obama especi reach muslim world obama third sit presid award nobel peac prize third african american receiv prize eight half month inaugur white hous announc obama would travel oslo decemb accept prize obama plan donat full million swedish kronor u million monetari award chariti initi reaction award mix among nobel laureat former vice presid al gore call award extrem well deserv wherea former presid poland lech wałęsa receiv prize said soon soon yet made real input jagland chairman nobel committe said hope award would assist obama foreign polici effort ad given prize may happen futur award obama done past year hope may contribut littl bit tri jagland said committe influenc speech obama gave islam cairo june well presid effort prevent nuclear prolifer climat chang well obama support use establish intern bodi unit nation pursu foreign polici goal obama third sit presid award nobel peac prize other theodor roosevelt woodrow wilson former presid jimmi carter receiv award leav offic addit sit vice presid charl daw austen chamberlain former vice presid al gore intergovernment panel climat chang obama third african american win honor other ralph bunch martin luther king obama said surpris deepli humbl award state feel deserv award say feel worthi compani award would place remark given white hous rose garden day announc obama state view recognit accomplish rather affirm american leadership behalf aspir held peopl nation award drew initi critic undeserv prematur due perceiv lack signific accomplish obama part far role conflict abroad howev opinion widespread critic nobel committe decis comment editori writer across polit spectrum today host matt lauer said le year first term presid tri know rude major foreign polici achiev date peter beinart daili beast call decis farc said obama done noth deserv prize jonah goldberg nation review said sure someon mayb iranian protestor benefit receiv prize presid far done virtual noth concret world peac welcom reaction came europ french presid nicola sarkozi said award would reinforc obama determin work justic peac ad award final confirm return america heart peopl world russian presid dmitri medvedev said award encourag warmer relat hope would serv addit incent govern foster better climat world polit british prime minist gordon brown sent privat messag congratul presid obama hope prize would assist obama effort toward nuclear disarma also part congratulatori statement ireland taoiseach brian cowen german chancellor angela merkel vatican spokesman fr federico lombardi said vatican appreci nomin,C1
99,Ernest hemingway biography,"Ernest Miller Hemingway was an American author and journalist. He was born on July 21, 1899 in Oak Park, Illinois, where he was raised. He died on July 2, 1961 in Ketchum, Idaho.
Hemingway's economical and understated style had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his life of adventure and his public image influenced later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. He published seven novels, six short story collections, and two non-fiction works. Three novels, four collections of short stories, and three non-fiction works were published posthumously.
After finishing high school, Hemingway reported for a few months for The Kansas City Star, before leaving for the Italian front to enlist with the World War I ambulance drivers where he was wounded in 1918 and returned home. Hemingway's experiences in wartime formed the basis for his novel A Farewell to Arms. In 1922, he married Hadley Richardson, the first of his four wives. The couple moved to Paris, where he worked as a foreign correspondent, and fell under the influence of the modernist writers and artists of the 1920s ""Lost Generation"" expatriate community. The Sun Also Rises, Hemingway's first novel, was published in 1926.
Hemingway married Pauline Pfeiffer after his 1927 divorce from Hadley Richardson. However this marriage was also unsuccessful and the couple divorced after Hemingway returned from the Spanish Civil War where he had been a journalist. Drawing from his experience in the Spanish Civil War, Hemingway published For Whom the Bell Tolls. He married his third wife, Martha Gellhorn in 1940. They separated when he met Mary Welsh in London during World War II.
Shortly after the publication of The Old Man and the Sea, one of his masterpieces, in 1952, Hemingway went on safari to Africa, where he was almost killed in two successive plane crashes that left him in pain or ill health for much of the rest of his life. Hemingway had permanent residences in Key West, Florida, and Cuba during the 1930s and 1940s, but in 1959 he moved from Cuba to Ketchum, Idaho, where he put an end to his life in the summer of 1961.",ernest miller hemingway american author journalist born juli oak park illinoi rais die juli ketchum idaho hemingway econom underst style strong influenc fiction life adventur public imag influenc later gener hemingway produc work nobel prize literatur publish seven novel six short stori collect two work three novel four collect short stori three work publish posthum finish high school hemingway report month kansa citi star leav italian front enlist world war ambul driver wound return home hemingway experi wartim form basi novel farewel arm marri hadley richardson first four wive coupl move pari work foreign correspond fell influenc modernist writer artist lost gener expatri commun sun also rise hemingway first novel publish hemingway marri paulin pfeiffer divorc hadley richardson howev marriag also unsuccess coupl divorc hemingway return spanish civil war journalist draw experi spanish civil war hemingway publish bell toll marri third wife martha gellhorn separ met mari welsh london world war ii shortli public old man sea one masterpiec hemingway went safari africa almost kill two success plane crash left pain ill health much rest life hemingway perman resid key west florida cuba move cuba ketchum idaho put end life summer,C1
100,Ernest hemingway style,"The Iceberg Theory is the writing style of American writer Ernest Hemingway. Influenced by his journalistic career, Hemingway contendedt that by omitting superfluous and extraneous matter, writing becomes more interesting. When he became a writer of short stories, he retained this minimalistic style, focusing on surface elements without explicitly discussing the underlying themes. Hemingway believed the true meaning of a piece of writing should not be evident from the surface story, rather, the crux of the story lies below the surface and should be allowed to shine through. Critics such as Jackson Benson claim that his iceberg theory, also known as the theory of omission, in combination with his distinctive clarity of writing, functioned as a means to distance himself from the characters he created.
""If a writer of prose knows enough of what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them. The dignity of movement of an ice-berg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water.

101,Brave new world by aldous huxley,"Brave New World is a dystopian novel which explores a futuristic totalitarian social and political structures. It was written by the English author Aldous Huxley in 1931 and published in 1932. It portrays a futuristic World State, whose citizens are environmentally engineered into an intelligence-based social hierarchy. The novel anticipates huge scientific advancements in reproductive technology, sleep-learning, psychological manipulation and classical conditioning that are combined to make a dystopian society which is challenged by only a single individual: the story's protagonist. Although Huxley imagines a world free from pain and suffering, it is, nonetheless, meaningless.
The story takes place in A.F. 632, about seven centuries after the twentieth century in the World State city of London. The abbreviation A.F. stands for After Ford, the incredible industrialist Henry Ford who invented large scale manufacturing procedures. According to the novel, World Controllers rule the world and guarantee the security of society through the conception of a system that consists of different classes. At the top of the system, there are two classes, Alphas, and Betas. They represent the intelligentsia of the social structure. They are mainly scientists, politicians, and other top minds. At the bottom of the system, there are three other classes, namely, Gammas, Deltas, and Epsilons. They are principally the world's industrial working classes. The whole society lives in a state of eternal happiness thanks to a drug named soma. This drug guarantees that nobody ever feels depressed or experience pain. The members of every class receive provisions of the drug. This 'brave new world' is also characterized by pre- and post-natal conditioning which further guarantees peaceful social stability.
Who is God in Brave New World?
God is replaced by, on the one hand, Ford, the father of industrial mass production, and on the other hand, the mind-altering drugs called soma - According to Huxley it is a sort of Christianity without tears. The distinctive symbol of the Christian faith, the cross, is replaced by a deformed T, which symbolizes the T-Model invented by the renowned industrialist, Ford.
One of the most salient messages of Brave New World is the alarm raised by Huxley against the dangers of technology. Using scientific and technological advances to control society may give more power to totalitarian states to change the way human beings think and act. Relying on technologies may end up controlling human beings and stifling freedom. The real meaning of freedom is another theme discussed by Aldous Huxley. Lenina, one of the characters in the novel, insists that everyone has a great deal of freedom in the World State. It is the freedom to get whatever you want and to have a wonderful time. But is it really freedom? Soma, the drug that everyone has a right to, transform people into a hypnotic state in which they don't have to question things and accept the so-called happy life it provides them with.
Another message Brave New World tries to convey is related to self-gratification and happiness. Is always satisfying desire conducive to real happiness? The World State makes sure that all its citizens get precisely what they desire all the time. But what is the cost of this so-called happiness? The novel shows that the price of this superficial happiness is false stability. It is stability at the expense of deep thinking and true passion. It is a stability that eliminates human experience as enriching and character-forming.
Since its publication, Brave New World has been the target of so much criticism for supposed emphasis on sex and drugs and being anti-family and anti-religion. It has been subject to censorship many times. The American Library Association ranks Brave New World as No. 52 on their list of most challenged books.",brave new world dystopian novel explor futurist totalitarian social polit structur written english author aldou huxley publish portray futurist world state whose citizen environment engin social hierarchi novel anticip huge scientif advanc reproduct technolog psycholog manipul classic condit combin make dystopian societi challeng singl individu stori protagonist although huxley imagin world free pain suffer nonetheless meaningless stori take place seven centuri twentieth centuri world state citi london abbrevi stand ford incred industrialist henri ford invent larg scale manufactur procedur accord novel world control rule world guarante secur societi concept system consist differ class top system two class alpha beta repres intelligentsia social structur mainli scientist politician top mind bottom system three class name gamma delta epsilon princip world industri work class whole societi live state etern happi thank drug name soma drug guarante nobodi ever feel depress experi pain member everi class receiv provis drug new world also character condit guarante peac social stabil god brave new world god replac one hand ford father industri mass product hand drug call soma accord huxley sort christian without tear distinct symbol christian faith cross replac deform symbol invent renown industrialist ford one salient messag brave new world alarm rais huxley danger technolog use scientif technolog advanc control societi may give power totalitarian state chang way human be think act reli technolog may end control human be stifl freedom real mean freedom anoth theme discus aldou huxley lenina one charact novel insist everyon great deal freedom world state freedom get whatev want wonder time realli freedom soma drug everyon right transform peopl hypnot state question thing accept happi life provid anoth messag brave new world tri convey relat happi alway satisfi desir conduc real happi world state make sure citizen get precis desir time cost happi novel show price superfici happi fals stabil stabil expens deep think true passion stabil elimin human experi enrich sinc public brave new world target much critic suppos emphasi sex drug subject censorship mani time american librari associ rank brave new world list challeng book,C1
102,Ancient olympic games,"The Ancient Olympic Games were held in Greece. It is believed that Heracles was the initiator of the games in honor of the Gods, especially Zeus. The legend says that it was Heracles who first called the Games ""Olympic"" and established the custom of holding them every four years. The games were a series of competitions held between representatives of several city-states and kingdoms in Ancient Greece. These games featured mainly athletic but also combat and chariot racing events. During the games, all conflicts among the participating city-states were postponed until the games were finished.
The Olympic Games reached their zenith in the 6th and 5th centuries BC, but then gradually declined in importance as the Romans gained power and influence in Greece. While there is no scholarly consensus as to when the Games officially ended, the most commonly held date is 393 AD, when the emperor Theodosius I decreed that all pagan cults and practices be eliminated.

103,The lost city of atlantis,"The lost city of Atlantis is a fictional island mentioned in Plato's works Timaeus and Critias, where it represents the antagonist naval power that besieges ""Ancient Athens"". In the story, Athens was able to repel the Atlantean attack, unlike any other nation of the known world, supposedly giving testament to the superiority of Plato's concept of a state as described in his work the Republic. At the end of the story, Atlantis eventually falls out of favor with the gods and famously submerges into the Atlantic Ocean.
Despite its minor importance in Plato's work, the Atlantis story has had a considerable impact on literature. The allegorical aspect of Atlantis was taken up in utopian works of several Renaissance writers, such as Bacon's New Atlantis and More's Utopia.
Plato's vague indications of the time of the events—more than 9,000 years before his day—and the alleged location of Atlantis—""beyond the Pillars of Hercules"", an area at the entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar.—has led to much pseudoscientific speculation. As a consequence, Atlantis has become a byword for any and all supposed advanced prehistoric lost civilizations and continues to inspire contemporary fiction, from comic books to films.
Many teams of scientists have tried to identify the location of the lost city of Atlantis in vain. Many of the proposed sites share some of the characteristics of the Atlantis story (water, catastrophic end, relevant period), but none has been demonstrated to be a true historical Atlantis.",lost citi atlanti fiction island mention plato work timaeu critia repres antagonist naval power besieg ancient athen stori athen abl repel atlantean attack unlik nation known world supposedli give testament superior plato concept state describ work republ end stori atlanti eventu fall favor god famous submerg atlant ocean despit minor import plato work atlanti stori consider impact literatur allegor aspect atlanti taken utopian work sever renaiss writer bacon new atlanti utopia plato vagu indic time year alleg locat beyond pillar hercul area entranc strait led much pseudoscientif specul consequ atlanti becom byword suppos advanc prehistor lost civil continu inspir contemporari fiction comic book film mani team scientist tri identifi locat lost citi atlanti vain mani propos site share characterist atlanti stori water catastroph end relev period none demonstr true histor atlanti,C1
104,Seneca biography,"Lucius Annaeus Seneca (c. 4 BC–AD 65) —also known as Seneca the Younger or simply as Seneca — was born in Corduba, Spain. He was a Roman Stoic philosopher, statesman, and dramatist. He was raised in Rome, where he was trained in rhetoric and philosophy.
Seneca tells us that he was taken to Rome in the ""arms"" of his aunt (his mother's stepsister) at a young age, probably when he was about five years old. His father resided for much of his life in the city. Seneca was taught the usual subjects of literature, grammar, and rhetoric, as part of the standard education of high-born Romans. While still young he received philosophical training from Attalus the Stoic.
After a successful career as a senator and a period of exile in Corsica on a charge of adultery with the princess Julia Livilla, emperor Claudius’s niece, Seneca became first Nero's tutor, then his advisor when the latter became emperor. It was thanks to the influence of Agrippina, Nero's mother, that Seneca was recalled to Rome.
As a writer, Seneca is known for his philosophical works, and for his plays, which are all tragedies. Seneca regards philosophy as a balm for the wounds of life. The destructive passions, especially anger and grief, must be uprooted, although sometimes he offers advice for moderating them according to reason. He discusses the relative merits of the contemplative life and the active life, and he considers it important to confront one's own mortality and be able to face death.
Seneca was also a dramatist. Scholars have tried to spot certain Stoic themes in his tragedies: it is the uncontrolled passions which generate madness, ruination, and self-destruction. This has a cosmic as well as an ethical aspect, and fate is a powerful, albeit rather oppressive, force.
Seneca was forced to take his own life for alleged complicity in the Pisonian conspiracy to assassinate Nero. The conspiracy was organized by Gaius Calpurnius Piso in AD 65. The plot reflected the growing discontent among the ruling class of the Roman state with Nero's increasingly despotic leadership. Although it is unlikely that Seneca was part of the conspiracy, Nero ordered him to kill himself. Seneca followed tradition by severing several veins in order to bleed to death, and his wife Pompeia Paulina attempted to share his fate. Fortunately, she was saved and was spared by the emperor.",luciu annaeu seneca known seneca younger simpli seneca born corduba spain roman stoic philosoph statesman dramatist rais rome train rhetor philosophi seneca tell u taken rome arm aunt mother stepsist young age probabl five year old father resid much life citi seneca taught usual subject literatur grammar rhetor part standard educ roman still young receiv philosoph train attalu stoic success career senat period exil corsica charg adulteri princess julia livilla emperor claudiu niec seneca becam first nero tutor advisor latter becam emperor thank influenc agrippina nero mother seneca recal rome writer seneca known philosoph work play tragedi seneca regard philosophi balm wound life destruct passion especi anger grief must uproot although sometim offer advic moder accord reason discus rel merit contempl life activ life consid import confront one mortal abl face death seneca also dramatist scholar tri spot certain stoic theme tragedi uncontrol passion gener mad ruinat cosmic well ethic aspect fate power albeit rather oppress forc seneca forc take life alleg complic pisonian conspiraci assassin nero conspiraci organ gaiu calpurniu piso ad plot reflect grow discont among rule class roman state nero increasingli despot leadership although unlik seneca part conspiraci nero order kill seneca follow tradit sever sever vein order bleed death wife pompeia paulina attempt share fate fortun save spare emperor,C1
105,Steve jobs biography,"Steve Jobs, the American businessman and technology visionary who is best known as the co-founder, chairman, and chief executive officer of Apple Inc, was born on February 24, 1955. His parents were two University of Wisconsin graduate students, Joanne Carole Schieble and Syrian-born Abdulfattah Jandali. They were both unmarried at the time. Jandali, who was teaching in Wisconsin when Steve was born, said he had no choice but to put the baby up for adoption because his girlfriend's family objected to their relationship.
The baby was adopted at birth by Paul Reinhold Jobs (1922–1993) and Clara Jobs (1924–1986). Later, when asked about his ""adoptive parents,"" Jobs replied emphatically that Paul and Clara Jobs ""were my parents."" He stated in his authorized biography that they ""were my parents 1,000%."" Unknown to him, his biological parents would subsequently marry (December 1955), have a second child, novelist Mona Simpson, in 1957, and divorce in 1962.
The Jobs family moved from San Francisco to Mountain View, California when Steve was five years old. The parents later adopted a daughter, Patti. Paul was a machinist for a company that made lasers, and taught his son rudimentary electronics and how to work with his hands. The father showed Steve how to work on electronics in the family garage, demonstrating to his son how to take apart and rebuild electronics such as radios and televisions. As a result, Steve became interested in and developed a hobby of technical tinkering. Clara was an accountant who taught him to read before he went to school.
Jobs's youth was riddled with frustrations over formal schooling. At Monta Loma Elementary school in Mountain View, he was a prankster whose fourth-grade teacher needed to bribe him to study. Jobs tested so well, however, that administrators wanted to skip him ahead to high school—a proposal his parents declined. Jobs then attended Cupertino Junior High and Homestead High School in Cupertino, California. During the following years Jobs met Bill Fernandez and Steve Wozniak, a computer whiz kid.
Following high school graduation in 1972, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. Reed was an expensive college which Paul and Clara could ill afford. They were spending much of their life savings on their son's higher education. Jobs dropped out of college after six months and spent the next 18 months dropping in on creative classes, including a course on calligraphy. He continued auditing classes at Reed while sleeping on the floor in friends' dorm rooms, returning Coke bottles for food money, and getting weekly free meals at the local Hare Krishna temple
In 1976, Wozniak invented the Apple I computer. Jobs, Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne, an electronics industry worker, founded Apple computer in the garage of Jobs's parents in order to sell it. They received funding from a then-semi-retired Intel product-marketing manager and engineer Mike Markkula.
Through Apple, Jobs was widely recognized as a charismatic pioneer of the personal computer revolution and for his influential career in the computer and consumer electronics fields. Jobs also co-founded and served as chief executive of Pixar Animation Studios; he became a member of the board of directors of The Walt Disney Company in 2006, when Disney acquired Pixar.

106,Walt disney characters,"Yes, all started with a mouse. But since the creation of Mickey Mouse in 1928, hundreds of characters have been born from the imagination of Disney Studios. Some have known worldwide fame and success. Others appeared only a few times but have nevertheless contributed to the originality, humor and the freshness of Walt Disney productions.
The following is a list of the most popular Walt Disney Characters:
1. Mickey Mouse was created in 1928 by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks and voiced by Walt Disney. He first appeared in Steamboat Willie. He evolved from being simply a character in animated cartoons and comic strips to become one of the most recognizable symbols in the world. His popularity is mainly due to his angelic nature.
2.Donald Duck first appeared in the Silly Symphonies cartoon The Wise Little Hen on June 9, 1934. He is a white anthropomorphic duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. Donald's most famous personality trait is his easily provoked and explosive temper.
3. Goofy is an anthropomorphic dog and is one of Mickey Mouse's best friends. His original concept name was ""Dippy Dawg"" in cartoon shorts created during the 1930s. Along with being predictably clumsy, Goofy is often shown as having little to no intelligence. But this interpretation isn't always definitive; occasionally, Goofy is shown as intuitive and clever, albeit in his own unique, eccentric way.
4. Pluto, also called Pluto the Pup, is a cartoon dog created in 1930. He  most frequently appeared as Mickey Mouse's pet dog. He also had an independent starring role in 48 Disney shorts in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. Pluto is unusual for a Disney character in that he is not anthropomorphized beyond showing an unusually broad range of facial expressions or use of his front paws at key points; he is actually represented as a normal dog (unlike Goofy who is an anthropomorphic dog)",ye start mous sinc creation mickey mous hundr charact born imagin disney studio known worldwid fame success other appear time nevertheless contribut origin humor fresh walt disney product follow list popular walt disney charact mickey mous creat walt disney ub iwerk voic walt disney first appear steamboat willi evolv simpli charact anim cartoon comic strip becom one recogniz symbol world popular mainli due angel natur duck first appear silli symphoni cartoon wise littl hen june white anthropomorph duck bill leg foot donald famou person trait easili provok explos temper goofi anthropomorph dog one mickey mous best friend origin concept name dippi dawg cartoon short creat along predict clumsi goofi often shown littl intellig interpret alway definit occasion goofi shown intuit clever albeit uniqu eccentr way pluto also call pluto pup cartoon dog creat frequent appear mickey mous pet dog also independ star role disney short pluto unusu disney charact anthropomorph beyond show unusu broad rang facial express use front paw key point actual repres normal dog unlik goofi anthropomorph dog,B2

108,Vincent van gogh,"Vincent Willem van Gogh is a well-known Dutch post-Impressionist painter. During his lifetime, Van Gogh remained poor and unkknown.
Van Gogh was born on March 30, 1853, to upper middle class parents. He spent his early adulthood working for a firm of art dealers before traveling to The Hague, London and Paris.
He was deeply religious as a younger man and aspired to be a pastor, like his father. He became a teacher in England and then he worked as a missionary in a mining region in Belgium where he sketched people from the local community, and in 1885 painted his first major work The Potato Eaters. His palette then consisted mainly of somber earth tones and showed no sign of the vivid coloration that distinguished his later paintings.
In March 1886, he moved to Paris and discovered the French Impressionists. He met many artists including Degas, Toulouse-Lautrec, Pissarro and Gauguin, with whom he became friends. Later, he moved to the south of France and was influenced by the region's strong sunlight. His paintings grew brighter in color, and he developed the unique and highly recognizable style that became fully realized during his stay in Arles in 1888.
Van Gogh invited Gauguin to join him in Arles, but their relationship began to deteriorate. Van Gogh admired Gauguin and desperately wanted to be treated as his equal, but Gauguin was arrogant and domineering, something that often frustrated Van Gogh. They quarreled about art; Van Gogh increasingly feared that Gauguin was going to desert him, and the situation, which Van Gogh described as one of ""excessive tension,"" rapidly headed towards a crisis point. Deeply remorseful, he then cut off part of his own ear.
This incident was the first serious sign of the mental health problems that were to afflict Van Gogh for the remaining days of his life. He spent time in psychiatric hospitals and swung between periods of inertia, depression and incredibly concentrated artistic activity. His work reflected the intense colours and strong light of the countryside around him. On May 9, 1889, he asked to be admitted to the asylum at Saint-Rémy-de Provence, a hospital for the mentally ill. In the year Van Gogh spent at the asylum he worked as much as he had at Arles, producing 150 paintings and hundreds of drawings.
Van Gogh went to Paris on May 17, 1890, to visit his brother, Theo. On the advice of Pissarro, Theo had Vincent go to Auvers, just outside Paris. At first, Van Gogh felt relieved at Auvers, but toward the end of June he experienced fits of temper and often quarreled with Gachet. On July 27, 1890, he shot himself in a lonely field and died, two days later, in the morning of July 29, 1890.
The most comprehensive primary source for understanding Van Gogh is the collection of letters between him and his younger brother, art dealer Theo van Gogh. They lay the foundation for most of what is known about his thoughts and beliefs.Theo provided his brother with financial and emotional support. The brother's lifelong friendship, and most of what is known of Vincent's thoughts and theories of art, is recorded in the hundreds of letters exchanged between 1872 and 1890. There are more than 600 from Vincent to Theo, and 40 from Theo to Vincent.",vincent willem van gogh dutch painter lifetim van gogh remain poor unkknown van gogh born march upper middl class parent spent earli adulthood work firm art dealer travel hagu london pari deepli religi younger man aspir pastor like father becam teacher england work missionari mine region belgium sketch peopl local commun paint first major work potato eater palett consist mainli somber earth tone show sign vivid color distinguish later paint march move pari discov french impressionist met mani artist includ dega pissarro gauguin becam friend later move south franc influenc region strong sunlight paint grew brighter color develop uniqu highli recogniz style becam fulli realiz stay arl van gogh invit gauguin join arl relationship began deterior van gogh admir gauguin desper want treat equal gauguin arrog domin someth often frustrat van gogh quarrel art van gogh increasingli fear gauguin go desert situat van gogh describ one excess tension rapidli head toward crisi point deepli remors cut part ear incid first seriou sign mental health problem afflict van gogh remain day life spent time psychiatr hospit swung period inertia depress incred concentr artist activ work reflect intens colour strong light countrysid around may ask admit asylum provenc hospit mental ill year van gogh spent asylum work much arl produc paint hundr draw van gogh went pari may visit brother theo advic pissarro theo vincent go auver outsid pari first van gogh felt reliev auver toward end june experienc fit temper often quarrel gachet juli shot lone field die two day later morn juli comprehens primari sourc understand van gogh collect letter younger brother art dealer theo van gogh lay foundat known thought provid brother financi emot support brother lifelong friendship known vincent thought theori art record hundr letter exchang vincent theo theo vincent,B2
109,Culture,"A stereotype is a fixed idea that people have about what specific social groups or individuals are like, especially an idea that is wrong. Other terms that are associated with the term stereotype are prejudice and cliché. The term has a Greek origin: stereos means solid or firm and typos mean blow, impression, engraved or mark. The term was first used in the printing business. The first modern English use of the term was in 1850, meaning ""image perpetuated without change.""
Because stereotypes are standardized and simplified ideas of groups, based on some prejudices, they are not derived from objective facts, but rather subjective and often unverifiable ideas. As Sociologist Charles E. Hurst states* ""One reason for stereotypes is the lack of personal, concrete familiarity that individuals have with persons in other racial or ethnic groups. Lack of familiarity encourages the lumping together of unknown individuals"".
The existence of stereotypes may be explained by the need of groups of people to view themselves as more normal or more superior than other groups. Consequently, stereotypes may be used to justify ill-founded prejudices or ignorance and prevent people of stereotyped groups from entering or succeeding in various activities or fields. The stereotyping group are, generally, reluctant to reconsider their attitudes and behavior towards stereotyped group.
Stereotypes may affect people negatively. This includes forming inaccurate and distorted images and opinions of people. Stereotypes may also be used for scapegoating or for making general erroneous judgments about people. Some stereotyping people may feel comfortable when they prevent themselves from emotional identification with the stereotyped group, which leads to xenophobic or racist behavior. Finally another serious consequence of stereotypes is the feeling of inferiority that the stereotyped people may have and which may impair their performance.",stereotyp fix idea peopl specif social group individu like especi idea wrong term associ term stereotyp prejudic cliché term greek origin stereo mean solid firm typo mean blow impress engrav mark term first use print busi first modern english use term mean imag perpetu without chang stereotyp standard simplifi idea group base prejudic deriv object fact rather subject often unverifi idea sociologist charl hurst state one reason stereotyp lack person concret familiar individu person racial ethnic group lack familiar encourag lump togeth unknown individu exist stereotyp may explain need group peopl view normal superior group consequ stereotyp may use justifi prejudic ignor prevent peopl stereotyp group enter succeed variou activ field stereotyp group gener reluct reconsid attitud behavior toward stereotyp group stereotyp may affect peopl neg includ form inaccur distort imag opinion peopl stereotyp may also use scapego make gener erron judgment peopl stereotyp peopl may feel comfort prevent emot identif stereotyp group lead xenophob racist behavior final anoth seriou consequ stereotyp feel inferior stereotyp peopl may may impair perform,B2
110,Do whales sleep,"Whales are mammals, so in many ways, they are just like human beings. The most important difference is that humans and whales live in different environments and whales have a special respiratory system that enables them to stay underwater for several minutes without breathing oxygen. For this reason, they are said to be voluntary breathers. That is, because of whales underwater environment, they must be conscious breathers. They think about every breath they take and come up to the surface of the water to breathe through blowholes on top of their heads.
What is outstanding about whales is the way they can sleep. While all mammals sleep, whales cannot afford to become unconscious for long because they may drown. The only way they can sleep is by remaining partially conscious. It is believed that only one hemisphere of the whale's brain sleeps at a time, so they rest but are never completely asleep. They can do so most probably near the surface so that they can come up for air easily.",whale mammal mani way like human be import differ human whale live differ environ whale special respiratori system enabl stay underwat sever minut without breath oxygen reason said voluntari breather whale underwat environ must consciou breather think everi breath take come surfac water breath blowhol top head outstand whale way sleep mammal sleep whale afford becom unconsci long may drown way sleep remain partial consciou believ one hemispher whale brain sleep time rest never complet asleep probabl near surfac come air easili,B2
111,The beatles,"The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as ""Beatlemania"", which is a term that describe the intense fan frenzy directed toward the British band. The phenomenon began in 1963 and continued past the band's breakup in 1970.
The Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960, with Stuart Sutcliffe initially serving as bass player. The core of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison went through a succession of drummers, most notably Pete Best, before asking Starr to join them. They gained popularity in the United Kingdom after their first hit, ""Love Me Do"", in late 1962. They acquired the nickname ""the Fab Four"" as Beatlemania grew in Britain over the following year, and by early 1964 they had become international stars, leading the ""British Invasion"" of the United States pop market. From 1965 onwards, the Beatles produced what many consider their finest material, including the innovative and widely influential albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966), Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), The Beatles (commonly known as the White Album, 1968) and Abbey Road (1969).
After their break-up in 1970, they each enjoyed successful musical careers of varying lengths. McCartney and Starr, the surviving members, remain musically active. Lennon was shot and killed in December 1980, and Harrison died of lung cancer in November 2001.",beatl english rock band form liverpool member john lennon paul mccartney georg harrison ringo starr becam wide regard foremost influenti act rock era earli enorm popular first emerg beatlemania term describ intens fan frenzi direct toward british band phenomenon began continu past band breakup beatl built reput play club liverpool hamburg period stuart sutcliff initi serv bass player core lennon mccartney harrison went success drummer notabl pete best ask starr join gain popular unit kingdom first hit love late acquir nicknam fab four beatlemania grew britain follow year earli becom intern star lead british invas unit state pop market onward beatl produc mani consid finest materi includ innov wide influenti album rubber soul revolv sgt pepper lone heart club band beatl commonli known white album abbey road enjoy success music career vari length mccartney starr surviv member remain music activ lennon shot kill decemb harrison die lung cancer novemb,B2
112,Charles dickens biography,"Charles Dickens was an English writer and social critic. During his lifetime, his works enjoyed unprecedented popularity. He is now considered a literary genius because he created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. His novels and short stories enjoy lasting popularity.
Dickens was born on February 7, 1812  in Portsmouth, on the southern coast of England. His father, John Dickens, was a naval clerk who dreamed of becoming rich and his mother, Elizabeth Barrow, aspired to be a teacher and school director. But the family’s financial situation had grown worse because John Dickens used to spend money dangerously beyond the family’s means. Consequently, John was sent to prison for debt in 1824, when Charles was just 12 years old.
After his father's imprisonment, Charles Dickens left school to work in a factory. Despite his lack of formal education, he edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five novellas, hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, education, and other social reforms.
Dickens's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers. Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity, famous for his humor, satire, and keen observation of character and society. His novels, most published in monthly or weekly instalments, pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication.
Dickens was regarded as the literary colossus of his age. His 1843 novella, A Christmas Carol, remains popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre. Oliver Twist and Great Expectations are also frequently adapted, and, like many of his novels, evoke images of early Victorian London. His 1859 novel, A Tale of Two Cities, set in London and Paris, is his best-known work of historical fiction.
Dickens's creative genius has been praised by fellow writers—from Leo Tolstoy to George Orwell and G. K. Chesterton—for its realism, comedy, prose style, unique characterizations, and social criticism. On the other hand, Oscar Wilde, Henry James, and Virginia Woolf complained of a lack of psychological depth, loose writing, and a vein of saccharine sentimentalism. The term Dickensian is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social conditions or comically repulsive characters.
Charles Dickens died on June 9, 1870 of a stroke. He was buried in Poet’s Corner at Westminster Abbey. Thousands of mourners came to pay their respects at the grave and throw in flowers.",charl dicken english writer social critic lifetim work enjoy unpreced popular consid literari geniu creat world fiction charact regard greatest novelist victorian era novel short stori enjoy last popular dicken born februari portsmouth southern coast england father john dicken naval clerk dream becom rich mother elizabeth barrow aspir teacher school director famili financi situat grown wors john dicken use spend money danger beyond famili mean consequ john sent prison debt charl year old father imprison charl dicken left school work factori despit lack formal educ edit weekli journal year wrote novel five novella hundr short stori articl lectur perform extens indefatig letter writer campaign vigor child right educ social reform dicken literari success began serial public pickwick paper within year becom intern literari celebr famou humor satir keen observ charact societi novel publish monthli weekli instal pioneer serial public narr fiction becam domin victorian mode novel public dicken regard literari colossu age novella christma carol remain popular continu inspir adapt everi artist genr oliv twist great expect also frequent adapt like mani novel evok imag earli victorian london novel tale two citi set london pari work histor fiction dicken creativ geniu prais fellow leo tolstoy georg orwel realism comedi prose style uniqu character social critic hand oscar wild henri jame virginia woolf complain lack psycholog depth loo write vein saccharin sentiment term dickensian use describ someth reminisc dicken write poor social condit comic repuls charact charl dicken die june stroke buri poet corner westminst abbey thousand mourner came pay respect grave throw flower,B2
113,Renewable energy,"Renewable energy is energy that is environment-friendly because it is collected from renewable resources, which are naturally replenished. Examples of these renewable resources include sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat (i.e.the thermal energy generated and stored in the Earth). There is a distinction between renewable energy and alternative energy. The latter is generated from alternatives to fossil fuels and need not be renewable.
Global investments in renewable technologies were estimated to be more than US$286 billion in 2015. Countries like China and the United States invest heavily in wind, hydro, solar and biofuels. Globally, there are an estimated 7.7 million jobs associated with the renewable energy industries, with solar photovoltaics being the largest renewable employer. As of 2015 worldwide, more than half of all new electricity capacity installed was renewable.
There are a lot of benefits to using renewable energy. First, naturally replenished energy resources are found over wide geographical areas, in contrast to non-renewable resources, which exist only in a limited number of countries. In addition to that, rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency is resulting in significant energy security, climate change mitigation, and economic benefits. The results of a recent review of the literature concluded that as greenhouse gas emitters begin to be held liable for damages resulting from greenhouse gas emissions resulting in climate change, a high value for liability mitigation would provide powerful incentives for deployment of renewable energy technologies.
There are other undeniable advantages of renewable energy. Renewable technologies are also suited to rural and remote areas and developing countries, where energy is often crucial in human development. Former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity. Besides, as most renewables provide electricity, renewable energy deployment is often applied in conjunction with further electrification, which has several benefits:
In international public opinion surveys, there is strong support for promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power. At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20 percent of energy supply. National renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond. Some places and at least two countries, Iceland and Norway generate all their electricity using renewable energy already, and many other countries have set a goal to reach 100% renewable energy in the future. For example, in Denmark, the government decided to switch the total energy supply (electricity, mobility and heating/cooling) to 100% renewable energy by 2050.
Renewable energy systems are rapidly becoming more efficient and cheaper. Their share of total energy consumption is increasing. Growth in consumption of coal and oil could end by 2020 due to increased uptake of renewables and natural gas.",renew energi energi collect renew resourc natur replenish exampl renew resourc includ sunlight wind rain tide wave geotherm heat thermal energi gener store earth distinct renew energi altern energi latter gener altern fossil fuel need renew global invest renew technolog estim u billion countri like china unit state invest heavili wind hydro solar biofuel global estim million job associ renew energi industri solar photovolta largest renew employ worldwid half new electr capac instal renew lot benefit use renew energi first natur replenish energi resourc found wide geograph area contrast resourc exist limit number countri addit rapid deploy renew energi energi effici result signific energi secur climat chang mitig econom benefit result recent review literatur conclud greenhous ga emitt begin held liabl damag result greenhous ga emiss result climat chang high valu liabil mitig would provid power incent deploy renew energi technolog undeni advantag renew energi renew technolog also suit rural remot area develop countri energi often crucial human develop former unit nation ban said renew energi abil lift poorest nation new level prosper besid renew provid electr renew energi deploy often appli conjunct electrif sever benefit intern public opinion survey strong support promot renew sourc solar power wind power nation level least nation around world alreadi renew energi contribut percent energi suppli nation renew energi market project continu grow strongli come decad beyond place least two countri iceland norway gener electr use renew energi alreadi mani countri set goal reach renew energi futur exampl denmark govern decid switch total energi suppli electr mobil renew energi renew energi system rapidli becom effici cheaper share total energi consumpt increas growth consumpt coal oil could end due increas uptak renew natur ga,C1
114,Five pillars of islam,"The Five Pillars of Islam are the five duties incumbent on every Muslim. They are the foundation of Muslim life:
1.Shahadah is a statement professing monotheism and accepting Muhammad as God's messenger. The statement denotes faith or belief in the Oneness of God and the finality of the prophethood of Muhammad and is normally said in Arabic. It states: ""(I profess that) there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of God.""
2. Salah is the daily prayer of Islam. It consists of five prayers a day at sunrise, at noon, in the afternoon, at sunset and in the evening.
3. Zakāt or alms-giving is the practice of charitable giving by Muslims based on accumulated wealth, and is obligatory for all who are able to do so. It is considered to be a personal responsibility for Muslims to ease economic hardship for others and eliminate inequality. Zakat consists of spending 2.5% of one's wealth for the benefit of the poor or needy once a year.
4. Sawm is a ritual fasting which is an obligatory act during the month of Ramadan. Muslims must abstain from food, drink, and sexual intercourse from dawn to dusk during this month, and are to be especially mindful of other sins. It is a sort of self-purification.
5. The Hajj is a pilgrimage that occurs during the Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah to the holy city of Mecca. Every able-bodied Muslim is obliged to make the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in their lifetime if he or she can afford it. The pilgrimage to Makkah for those who are able.
As it is shown above the five pillars of Islam are obligatory on every adult Muslim . Some of these pillars or duties are done daily. or during a whole month. Others are done once a year or once in a lifetime.",five pillar islam five duti incumb everi muslim foundat muslim life statement profess monoth accept muhammad god messeng statement denot faith belief one god final prophethood muhammad normal said arab state profess god allah muhammad messeng god salah daili prayer islam consist five prayer day sunris noon afternoon sunset even zakāt practic charit give muslim base accumul wealth obligatori abl consid person respons muslim ea econom hardship other elimin inequ zakat consist spend one wealth benefit poor needi year sawm ritual fast obligatori act month ramadan muslim must abstain food drink sexual intercours dawn dusk month especi mind sin sort hajj pilgrimag occur islam month dhu holi citi mecca everi muslim oblig make pilgrimag mecca least lifetim afford pilgrimag makkah abl shown five pillar islam obligatori everi adult muslim pillar duti done daili whole month other done year lifetim,B1
115,Hypertension,"Hypertension is a chronic medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. Hypertension is also sometimes called high blood pressure. High blood pressure usually does not cause symptoms. Long-term high blood pressure, however, is a major risk factor for many illnesses such as coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease, vision loss, chronic kidney disease, and dementia.
According to statistics, about 90–95% of cases are primary hypertension. This type is defined as high blood pressure due to nonspecific lifestyle and genetic factors. Lifestyle factors that increase the risk include excess salt in the diet, excess body weight, smoking, and alcohol use. The remaining 5–10% of cases are categorized as secondary high blood pressure. This type of hypertension is defined as high blood pressure due to an identifiable cause, such as chronic kidney disease, narrowing of the kidney arteries, an endocrine disorder, or the use of birth control pills.
Blood pressure is expressed by two measurements, the systolic and diastolic pressures, which are the maximum and minimum pressures, respectively. For most adults, normal blood pressure at rest is within the range of 100–130 millimeters mercury (mmHg) systolic and 60–80 mmHg diastolic. For most adults, high blood pressure is present when the resting blood pressure is persistently at or above 130/90 or 140/90 mmHg. Different numbers apply to children. High arterial blood pressure affects between 16 and 37% of the population globally. In 2010 hypertension was believed to have been a factor in 18% of all deaths (9.4 million globally).
Lifestyle changes and medications can lower blood pressure and decrease the risk of health complications. Lifestyle changes include weight loss, decreased salt intake, physical exercise, and a healthy diet. If lifestyle changes are not sufficient then blood pressure medications are used. Up to three medications can control blood pressure in 90% of people. The treatment of moderately high arterial blood pressure with medications is associated with an improved life expectancy.",hypertens chronic medic condit blood pressur arteri persist elev hypertens also sometim call high blood pressur high blood pressur usual caus symptom high blood pressur howev major risk factor mani ill coronari arteri diseas stroke heart failur atrial fibril peripher vascular diseas vision loss chronic kidney diseas dementia accord statist case primari hypertens type defin high blood pressur due nonspecif lifestyl genet factor lifestyl factor increas risk includ excess salt diet excess bodi weight smoke alcohol use remain case categor secondari high blood pressur type hypertens defin high blood pressur due identifi caus chronic kidney diseas narrow kidney arteri endocrin disord use birth control pill blood pressur express two measur systol diastol pressur maximum minimum pressur respect adult normal blood pressur rest within rang millimet mercuri mmhg systol mmhg diastol adult high blood pressur present rest blood pressur persist mmhg differ number appli child high arteri blood pressur affect popul global hypertens believ factor death million global lifestyl chang medic lower blood pressur decreas risk health complic lifestyl chang includ weight loss decreas salt intak physic exercis healthi diet lifestyl chang suffici blood pressur medic use three medic control blood pressur peopl treatment moder high arteri blood pressur medic associ improv life expect,B2
116,New year resolutions and how to make them,"New Year resolutions are the perfect opportunity for the people who have failed to start making the changes that they have always wanted to make. Some of the most popular resolutions are to be a better person, to lose weight, to exercise more, to eat healthy food, to quit a bad habit such as smoking, to watch less TV, and to make more money. The problem with the New Year resolutions is that most of the time people fail to fulfill them These people do not follow specific steps in choosing and formulating achievable goals.
The first record of New Year resolutions dates back to the Babylonians. According to Wikipedia, the Babylonians made promises to their gods at the start of each year that they would return borrowed objects and pay their debts.
In Ancient Rome, the Romans practiced a similar ritual. The Romans offered sacrifices and made promises of good conduct for the coming year to Janus, a god with two heads and who symbolically looked back into the previous year and ahead into the future. The name of the month January takes its name from Janus.
With the advent of Christianity, some religious practices involved making resolutions. For instance, in the medieval era, the knights took the ""peacock vow"" at the end of the Christmas season each year to re-affirm their commitment to chivalry. Also, in some Christian traditions, at watch night services held on New Year’s Eve, many Christians prepare for the year ahead by praying and making these resolutions.
In the Jewish traditions, during Judaism's New Year, jews reflect upon one's wrongdoings over the year and both seek and offer forgiveness.
Nowadays the practice of making New Year resolutions has become more secular. Instead of making promises to the gods, most people make resolutions only for themselves. The aim is to reflect upon themselves and seek self-improvement.
Although many people are motivated to make resolutions to become better people, most of them fail to achieve their goals. In a 2014 report, 35% of participants who failed their New Year resolutions admitted they had unrealistic goals, 33% of participants didn't keep track of their progress, and 23% forgot about them; about one in 10 respondents claimed they made too many resolutions.
Richard Wiseman from the University of Bristol conducted research involving 3,000 people. It demonstrated that 88% of those who set New Year resolutions fail, although 52% of the study's participants were confident of success at the beginning. Men achieved their goal 22% more often when they engaged in goal setting, wherein resolutions are made in terms of small and measurable goals (e.g., ""lose a pound a week"" rather than ""lose weight"").
Most people fail to achieve their resolutions because they haven't chosen the right goals. These goals are either too vague or unrealistic. Researchers claim that to have favorable chances of success, goals should follow the SMART tool. That’s an acronym coined in the journal Management Review in 1981 for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. It is very helpful to set your resolutions according to this tool.
1. Specific. Resolutions have to be clear. Instead of saying do I want to make more money, it would be better to precise how much money you want to make. It is more effective to be concrete in setting goals.
2. Measurable. A measurable goal is one that has a very clear definition of success. It has a target you can measure. That is there should be concrete criteria for measuring progress toward the attainment of the goal. If you want to save money, you should ask yourself the following question: how much money exactly I want to save each month? For example, you can start with saving 100$ or 150$ and scale your savings according to your income.
3. Achievable. Trying to take unrealistic steps can be detrimental. For instance, deciding to save enough money to retire in five years when you’re 20 years old is probably not realistic, but saving an extra $100 a month may be.
4. Relevant. When setting objectives for yourself, consider whether they are relevant to you. Every one of your goals ought to align with your values, qualities, and bigger objectives. Questions you may ask yourself are: is this goal worthwhile? Does it go hand in hand with our other efforts and needs? For example, if you have to pay off a large amount of debt and you have a low income is the right time to start saving money?
5. Time-bound. Time-bound goals mean that they are completed within a very specific time frame. This provides some pressure to consistently work on a goal
Goals are excellent to give a sense of direction, but they're definitely not enough. In his book Atomic Habits, James clear stresses the importance of creating systems. For example, if you’re a coach, your goal might be to win a championship. Your system is the way you recruit players, manage your assistant coaches, and conduct practice. For a person who wants to become a musician. his goal might be to play a new piece. His system is how often he practices, how he breaks down and tackles difficult measures.
According to James clear, if you simply overlooked your goals and directed your attention only to your system, would you still make it? For example, if you were a basketball coach and you ignored your goal to win a championship and focused only on what your team does to practice each day, would you still get positive outcomes? The answer is yes. Focusing on what you have to do each day can lead you to success. That is why systems are important to develop good habits.",new year resolut perfect opportun peopl fail start make chang alway want make popular resolut better person lose weight exercis eat healthi food quit bad habit smoke watch le tv make money problem new year resolut time peopl fail fulfil peopl follow specif step choos formul achiev goal first record new year resolut date back babylonian accord wikipedia babylonian made promis god start year would return borrow object pay debt ancient rome roman practic similar ritual roman offer sacrific made promis good conduct come year janu god two head symbol look back previou year ahead futur name month januari take name janu advent christian religi practic involv make resolut instanc mediev era knight took peacock vow end christma season year commit chivalri also christian tradit watch night servic held new year eve mani christian prepar year ahead pray make resolut jewish tradit judaism new year jew reflect upon one wrongdo year seek offer forgiv nowaday practic make new year resolut becom secular instead make promis god peopl make resolut aim reflect upon seek although mani peopl motiv make resolut becom better peopl fail achiev goal report particip fail new year resolut admit unrealist goal particip keep track progress forgot one respond claim made mani resolut richard wiseman univers bristol conduct research involv peopl demonstr set new year resolut fail although studi particip confid success begin men achiev goal often engag goal set wherein resolut made term small measur goal lose pound week rather lose weight peopl fail achiev resolut chosen right goal goal either vagu unrealist research claim favor chanc success goal follow smart tool acronym coin journal manag review specif measur achiev relev help set resolut accord tool specif resolut clear instead say want make money would better precis much money want make effect concret set goal measur measur goal one clear definit success target measur concret criterion measur progress toward attain goal want save money ask follow question much money exactli want save month exampl start save scale save accord incom achiev tri take unrealist step detriment instanc decid save enough money retir five year year old probabl realist save extra month may relev set object consid whether relev everi one goal ought align valu qualiti bigger object question may ask goal worthwhil go hand hand effort need exampl pay larg amount debt low incom right time start save money goal mean complet within specif time frame provid pressur consist work goal goal excel give sen direct definit enough book atom habit jame clear stress import creat system exampl coach goal might win championship system way recruit player manag assist coach conduct practic person want becom musician goal might play new piec system often practic break tackl difficult measur accord jame clear simpli overlook goal direct attent system would still make exampl basketbal coach ignor goal win championship focus team practic day would still get posit outcom answer ye focus day lead success system import develop good habit,C1
117,Ramadan,"Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. It is the Islamic month of fasting, in which participating Muslims refrain from eating, drinking from dawn until sunset. Ramadan had been the name of the ninth month in Arabian culture long before the arrival of Islam. In the Qur'an it is said that ""fasting has been written down (as obligatory) upon you, as it was upon those before you"" which is a reference to the Jewish practice of fasting on Yom Kippur. Fasting is meant to teach the Muslim patience, modesty and spirituality.
Ramadan is a time for Muslims to fast for the sake of God and to offer more prayer than usual. During Ramadan, Muslims ask forgiveness for past sins, pray for guidance and help in refraining from everyday evils, and try to purify themselves through self-restraint and good deeds.
As compared to the solar calendar, the dates of Ramadan vary, moving backwards about ten days each year as it is a moving holiday depending on the moon. Ramadan was the month in which the first verses of the Qur'an were said to be revealed to the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. That was during a night that Muslims call Laylat al-Qadr (the night of decree or measures.) The night is believed to be one of the 10 last days of the month.
Ramadan ends with Eid ul-Fitr on the first of Shawwal, with much celebration and feasting.",ramadan ninth month islam calendar islam month fast particip muslim refrain eat drink dawn sunset ramadan name ninth month arabian cultur long arriv islam said fast written obligatori upon upon refer jewish practic fast yom kippur fast meant teach muslim patienc modesti spiritu ramadan time muslim fast sake god offer prayer usual ramadan muslim ask forgiv past sin pray guidanc help refrain everyday evil tri purifi good deed compar solar calendar date ramadan vari move backward ten day year move holiday depend moon ramadan month first vers said reveal islam prophet muhammad night muslim call laylat night decre measur night believ one last day month ramadan end eid first shawwal much celebr feast,B1

119,Trade unions,"Trade unions or labor unions first appeared in Europe as a result of the industrial revolution. Workers were at the mercy of the employer. They were underpaid, lacked any sort of training, and sometimes mistreated. When trade unions emerged, they became powerful organizations. Workers got together and organized themselves to make sure that employers do not exploit them any more.
Nowadays, the main goal of trade unions is to negotiate labor contracts with employers. The leaders of trade unions speak on behalf of workers and are predominantly worried about wages, working conditions and the laws that govern the hiring, firing and promotion of workers. In some cases unions may call for strikes to force employers to negotiate a deal or they may promote political legislation favorable to the interests of their members or workers as a whole. To achieve this aim they may support and get closely linked to particular political parties.
Some people blame unions for creating tense atmosphere between employers and employees. Others even accuse them of engendering relentless inflation. But the truth is that the working conditions have changed tremendously since the industrial revolution. Unions have contributed to considerably improve the standard of living. For instance, child labor is now prohibited by law. What is more, unions have also been credited for introducing minimum wage limits and for forbidding disreputable employers to exploit and mistreat their workers.",trade union labor union first appear europ result industri revolut worker merci employ underpaid lack sort train sometim mistreat trade union emerg becam power organ worker got togeth organ make sure employ exploit nowaday main goal trade union negoti labor contract employ leader trade union speak behalf worker predominantli worri wage work condit law govern hire fire promot worker case union may call strike forc employ negoti deal may promot polit legisl favor interest member worker whole achiev aim may support get close link particular polit parti peopl blame union creat ten atmospher employ employe other even accus engend relentless inflat truth work condit chang tremend sinc industri revolut union contribut consider improv standard live instanc child labor prohibit law union also credit introduc minimum wage limit forbid disreput employ exploit mistreat worker,C1
120,Cristiano ronaldo,"Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro, born on February 5th, 1985 and commonly known as Cristiano Ronaldo, is a Portuguese footballer who plays as a forward for Spanish club Real Madrid and serves as captain of the Portuguese national team. Ronaldo currently holds the distinction of being the most expensive player in football history after having transferred to Real Madrid from Manchester United in a deal worth £80 million (€94m, US$132m). His contract with Real Madrid is believed to have made him the highest-paid football player in the world.
Ronaldo began his career as a youth player for Andorinha, where he played for two years, then moved to Nacional. In 1997, he made a move to Portuguese giants Sporting CP. Ronaldo's precocious talent caught the attention of Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson and he signed the 18-year-old for £12.24 million in 2003. The following season, Ronaldo won his first club honour, the FA Cup, and reached the Euro 2004 final with Portugal, in which tournament he scored his first international goal.
In 2008, Ronaldo won the Champions League with United, and was named player of the tournament. He was named the FIFPro World Player of the Year and the FIFA World Player of the Year, in addition to becoming Manchester United's first Ballon d'Or winner in 40 years. Three-time Ballon d'Or winner Johan Cruyff said in an interview on 2 April 2008, ""Ronaldo is better than George Best and Denis Law, who were two brilliant and great players in the history of United.""",cristiano ronaldo do santo aveiro born februari commonli known cristiano ronaldo portugues footbal play forward spanish club real madrid serv captain portugues nation team ronaldo current hold distinct expens player footbal histori transfer real madrid manchest unit deal worth million u contract real madrid believ made footbal player world ronaldo began career youth player andorinha play two year move nacion made move portugues giant sport cp ronaldo precoci talent caught attent manchest unit manag alex ferguson sign million follow season ronaldo first club honour fa cup reach euro final portug tournament score first intern goal ronaldo champion leagu unit name player tournament name fifpro world player year fifa world player year addit becom manchest unit first ballon winner year ballon winner johan cruyff said interview april ronaldo better georg best deni law two brilliant great player histori unit,B1
121,Rainforests,"Rainforests are forests characterized by biodiversity and high rainfall, with annual rainfall between 250 and 450 centimeters (98 and 177 in). There are two types of rainforest: tropical rainforest and temperate rainforest. Tropical rainforests are characterized by a warm and wet climate with no substantial dry season: typically found within 10 degrees north and south of the equator in areas such as South America, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Temperate rainforests, however, are only found in few temperate regions around the world such as Europe, North America and East Asia.
Around 40% to 75% of all biotic species are indigenous to the rainforests. It has been estimated that there may be many millions of species of plants, insects and microorganisms still undiscovered in tropical rainforests. Tropical rainforests have been called the ""jewels of the Earth"" and the ""world's largest pharmacy"", because over one quarter of natural medicines have been discovered there. Rainforests are also responsible for 28% of the world's oxygen turnover; that is why ropical forests are also called ""Earth's lungs.""
Rainforests produce many items that we all use in our daily lives. Tropical rainforests provide timber as well as animal products such as meat and hides. Other common rainforests products include: chocolate, sugar, cinnamon, rubber, medicine, and pineapples. Rainforests also have value as tourism destinations and for the ecosystem services provided.",rainforest forest character biodivers high rainfal annual rainfal centimet two type rainforest tropic rainforest temper rainforest tropic rainforest character warm wet climat substanti dri season typic found within degre north south equat area south america southeast asia africa temper rainforest howev found temper region around world europ north america east asia around biotic speci indigen rainforest estim may mani million speci plant insect microorgan still undiscov tropic rainforest tropic rainforest call jewel earth world largest pharmaci one quarter natur medicin discov rainforest also respons world oxygen turnov ropic forest also call earth lung rainforest produc mani item use daili live tropic rainforest provid timber well anim product meat hide common rainforest product includ chocol sugar cinnamon rubber medicin pineappl rainforest also valu tourism destin ecosystem servic provid,B1
122,Computer addiction,"Computer addiction can be defined as the excessive or compulsive use of the computer which persists despite serious negative consequences for personal, social, or occupational function. The addiction involves online and/or offline computer usage and consists of at least 2 subtypes: excessive gaming, and e-mail/text messaging"".
The concept of computer addiction is broadly divided into two types, namely offline and online computer addiction. The term offline computer addiction is generally used when speaking about excessive gaming behavior, which can be practiced both offline and online. Online computer addiction, also known as Internet addiction, gets more attention in general from scientific research than offline computer addiction, mainly because most cases of computer addiction are related to the excessive use of the Internet.
The symptoms of computer addiction include
Researchers link internet/computer addiction with existing mental health issues, most notably depression. Studies showed that the majority of those who met the requirements of internet/computer addiction suffered from interpersonal difficulties and stress and that those addicted to online games specifically responded that they hoped to avoid reality.
There are many consequences resulting from computer addiction. For example, excessive computer use may result in lack of face to face social interaction. It may also lead to Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS), a condition that results in headaches, blurred vision, neck pain, fatigue, eye strain, dry eyes, irritated eyes, double vision, vertigo or dizziness.",comput addict defin excess compuls use comput persist despit seriou neg consequ person social occup function addict involv onlin offlin comput usag consist least subtyp excess game messag concept comput addict broadli divid two type name offlin onlin comput addict term offlin comput addict gener use speak excess game behavior practic offlin onlin onlin comput addict also known internet addict get attent gener scientif research offlin comput addict mainli case comput addict relat excess use internet symptom comput addict includ research link addict exist mental health issu notabl depress studi show major met requir addict suffer interperson difficulti stress addict onlin game specif respond hope avoid realiti mani consequ result comput addict exampl excess comput use may result lack face face social interact may also lead comput vision syndrom cv condit result headach blur vision neck pain fatigu eye strain dri eye irrit eye doubl vision vertigo dizzi,B2
123,Famous pharaohs,"This is a list of the most famous pharaohs. Pharaohs were the kings of ancient Egypt from the First Dynasty (c. 3150 BCE) until the Roman Annexation of Egypt in 30 BCE. The fantastic tombs and monuments that were buit in their honor tell us a lot about their power.

Tutankhamun, also called King Tut was nine years old when he became Pharaoh and reigned for approximately ten years. He is the world's best known pharaoh because his tomb is among the best preserved, and his image and associated artifacts the most-exhibited. In historical terms, Tutankhamun's significance stems from the fact that his reign was close to the apogee of Egypt as a world power and from his rejection of the radical religious innovations introduced by his predecessor and father, Akhenaten.

Cleopatra VII known to history simply as Cleopatra, was the last active ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt. She originally ruled jointly with her father Ptolemy XII Auletes, and later with her brothers Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator and Ptolemy XIV, whom she married as per Egyptian custom, but eventually she became sole ruler. As queen, she consummated a liaison with Julius Caesar that solidified her grip on the throne. She later elevated Caesarion, her son with Caesar, to co-ruler in name.
After the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC, she aligned with Mark Antony in opposition to Caesar's legal heir, Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus (later known as Augustus). With Antony, she bore the twins Cleopatra Selene II and Alexander Helios, and son Ptolemy Philadelphus. Antony committed suicide after losing the Battle of Actium to Octavian's forces, and Cleopatra followed suit. According to a popular belief, she killed herself by means of an asp bite on August 12, 30 BC.

Ramses II, also known as Ramesses the Great, is often regarded as the greatest, most celebrated, and most powerful pharaoh of the Egyptian Empire. He ruled during the New Kingdom for either 66 years. The early part of his reign was focused on building cities, temples, and monuments. By the time of his death, aged about 90 years, Ramesses was suffering from severe dental problems and was plagued by arthritis and hardening of the arteries. He had made Egypt rich from all the supplies and riches he had collected from other empires. He had outlived many of his wives and children and left great memorials all over Egypt. Nine more pharaohs took the name Ramesses in his honour.

Ramses III is considered to be the last monarch of the New Kingdom to wield any substantial authority over Egypt. His long reign saw the decline of Egyptian political and economic power, linked to a series of invasions and internal economic problems.
Ramesses III was assassinated in the Harem Conspiracy led by one of his secondary wives, Tiye, her son Pentawer, and a group of high officials.

Hatshepsut is generally regarded by Egyptologists as one of the most successful pharaohs, reigning longer than any other woman of an indigenous Egyptian dynasty. According to Egyptologist James Henry Breasted she is also known as ""the first great woman in history of whom we are informed.""

Akhenaten is noted for abandoning traditional Egyptian polytheism and introducing worship centered on the Aten

124,Stoicism,"Stoicism is a school of philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium in Athens in the early 3rd century BC. It is predominantly a philosophy of personal ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world. Stoicism developed throughout the Roman and Greek world until the 3rd century AD, and among its adherents was Emperor Marcus Aurelius. It witnessed a decline after Christianity became the state religion in the 4th century AD. Since then it has seen revivals, notably in the Renaissance (Neostoicism) and in the contemporary era (modern Stoicism).
According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to happiness for humans is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself, by not allowing oneself to be controlled by the desire for pleasure or fear of pain, by using one's mind to understand the world and to do one's part in nature's plan, and by working together and treating others fairly and justly.
For Stoics, ""virtue is the only good"" for human beings, and that external things—such as health, wealth, and pleasure—are not good or bad in themselves, but have value as ""material for virtue to act upon"". For example, let's suppose that you are trying to help a drug addict and they turn out to be unwilling to cooperate. In this case, it is wiser to direct one's effort and attention towards constructive virtues such as understanding and patience than to become disheartened by the incidence. Thus stoicism teaches the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive emotions. The philosophy holds that becoming a clear and unbiased thinker allows one to understand the universal reason (logos) and hence, to be free from negative emotions such as anger, envy, and jealousy.
Cleanthes, a stoic philosopher, once thought that the wicked man is ""like a dog tied to a cart, and compelled to go wherever it goes"". A Stoic of virtue, by contrast, would amend his will to suit the world and remain, in the words of Epictetus, ""sick and yet happy, in peril and yet happy, dying and yet happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy,"" thus positing a ""completely autonomous"" individual will, and at the same time a universe that is ""a rigidly deterministic single whole"".
A very important concept of stoicism is the distinction between things that are within one’s power and those that are not within our power. That is, there are things that are up to us (chiefly, our judgments and actions) while other things are not up to us (major historical events, natural phenomena, such as aging, getting ill, etc...). One path to our happiness is to differentiate between what we can change and what we can’t - what we have influence over and what we do not. For the things that we cannot control, we have to be aware that it is useless to fight an unwinnable battle. We should focus, instead, on the things that we can control. For instance, instead of losing temper when a train is delayed because of an accident, one has to concentrate on how to evaluate the event positively, to one's advantage. The events that happen to us are not inherently good or bad. However, it is within our power to decide how we value them and direct them towards our happiness.
Epictetus, another Stoic philosopher, holds that if people expect to get everything they want from the universe, then they are going to be disappointed. However, if one takes whatever the universe gives and takes a positive stance about them, then one will experience a much better and happier life.",stoicism school philosophi found zeno citium athen earli centuri bc predominantli philosophi person ethic inform system logic view natur world stoicism develop throughout roman greek world centuri ad among adher emperor marcu aureliu wit declin christian becam state religion centuri ad sinc seen reviv notabl renaiss neostoic contemporari era modern stoicism accord teach social be path happi human found accept moment present allow oneself control desir pleasur fear pain use one mind understand world one part natur plan work togeth treat other fairli justli stoic virtu good human be extern health wealth good bad valu materi virtu act upon exampl let suppos tri help drug addict turn unwil cooper case wiser direct one effort attent toward construct virtu understand patienc becom dishearten incid thu stoicism teach develop fortitud mean overcom destruct emot philosophi hold becom clear unbias thinker allow one understand univers reason logo henc free neg emot anger envi jealousi cleanth stoic philosoph thought wick man like dog tie cart compel go wherev goe stoic virtu contrast would amend suit world remain word epictetu sick yet happi peril yet happi die yet happi exil happi disgrac happi thu posit complet autonom individu time univers rigidli determinist singl whole import concept stoicism distinct thing within one power within power thing u chiefli judgment action thing u major histor event natur phenomenon age get ill etc one path happi differenti chang influenc thing control awar useless fight unwinn battl focu instead thing control instanc instead lose temper train delay accid one concentr evalu event posit one advantag event happen u inher good bad howev within power decid valu direct toward happi epictetu anoth stoic philosoph hold peopl expect get everyth want univers go disappoint howev one take whatev univers give take posit stanc one experi much better happier life,C2
125,Mardi gras,"Louisiana hosts one of the most well known celebrations - Mardi Gras. Mardi Gras is French for ""Fat Tuesday"". This holiday is sometimes called ""Shrove Tuesday"". People wear masks and costumes, overturn social conventions, dance, organize competitions and parades. Related popular practices were associated with celebrations before the fasting and religious obligations associated with the penitential season of Lent.
Today Mardi Gras is celebrated in many parts of the world - Brazil, Belgium, Italy, Panama. The American town which holds the biggest celebration is New Orleans, Louisiana. It was the French explorers who started this celebration on the Mississippi River in the late 17th century. Parades are divided into organizations called ""Krewe"". These Krewes are responsible for all aspects of their parades. The pxarades go in the streets ruled by the ""King and Queen."" Beads, ""doubloons"" and cups are thrown to the throngs of spectators by the riders as souvenirs of Mardi Gras.",louisiana host one well known celebr mardi gra mardi gra french fat tuesday holiday sometim call shrove tuesday peopl wear mask costum overturn social convent danc organ competit parad relat popular practic associ celebr fast religi oblig associ penitenti season lent today mardi gra celebr mani part world brazil belgium itali panama american town hold biggest celebr new orlean louisiana french explor start celebr mississippi river late centuri parad divid organ call krew krew respons aspect parad pxarad go street rule king queen bead doubloon cup thrown throng spectat rider souvenir mardi gra,B2
126,Apocalypse now,"Apocalypse Now is a 1979 American epic war film directed, produced, and co-written by Francis Ford Coppola. It stars Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Martin Sheen, Frederic Forrest, Albert Hall, Sam Bottoms, Laurence Fishburne, and Dennis Hopper. The screenplay, co-written by Coppola and John Milius (who received an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay) and featuring narration written by Michael Herr, is an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's novella Heart of Darkness.
Francis Ford Coppola's film ""Apocalypse Now"" was inspired by Heart of Darkness, a novella by Joseph Conrad. Kurtz and Marlow (whose corresponding character in the movie is Captain Willard) work for a Belgian trading company that brutally exploits its native African workers. Marlow was appointed as captain of a river steamboat. After days of sailing along the river, Marlow arrived at Kurtz's outpost and concludes that the latter has gone insane and is lording over a small tribe as a god. The novella ends with Kurtz dying on the trip back and the narrator musing about the darkness of the human psyche: ""the heart of an immense darkness"".
In Francis Ford's Coppola's film, Captain Willard is sent by Colonel Lucas and a General to carry out a mission that, officially, does not exist. The mission consists of seeking out and assassinating a mysterious Green Beret Colonel, Walter Kurtz, a renegade Army officer accused of murder who is presumed insane. Kurtz army has crossed the border into Cambodia and has set himself up as a god among a local tribe. During his secret mission, Willard confronts not only the same horrors and hypocrisy that pushed the level-headed Colonel Kurtz over the edge into an abyss of insanity, but the primal violence of human nature and the darkness of his own heart.
The film has been noted for the problems encountered while making it, chronicled in the documentary Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse (1991). These problems included Brando arriving on the set overweight and completely unprepared, expensive sets being destroyed by severe weather, and Sheen having a breakdown and suffering a near-fatal heart attack while on location. Problems continued after production as the release was postponed several times while Coppola edited thousands of feet of film.
Apocalypse Now was honored with the Palme d'Or at Cannes Film Festival, nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama. Initial reviews were mixed. Several critics found Coppola's handling of the story's major themes to be anticlimactic and intellectually disappointing. However, after being re-evaluated in subsequent years, Apocalypse Now is today considered to be one of the greatest films ever made. It ranked No. 14 in Sight & Sound's greatest films poll in 2012. In 2000, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically or aesthetically significant""",apocalyps american epic war film direct produc franci ford coppola star marlon brando robert duval martin sheen freder forrest albert hall sam bottom laurenc fishburn denni hopper screenplay coppola john miliu receiv oscar nomin best adapt screenplay featur narrat written michael herr adapt joseph conrad novella heart dark franci ford coppola film apocalyps inspir heart dark novella joseph conrad kurtz marlow whose correspond charact movi captain willard work belgian trade compani brutal exploit nativ african worker marlow appoint captain river steamboat day sail along river marlow arriv kurtz outpost conclud latter gone insan lord small tribe god novella end kurtz die trip back narrat muse dark human psych heart immens dark franci ford coppola film captain willard sent colonel luca gener carri mission offici exist mission consist seek assassin mysteri green beret colonel walter kurtz renegad armi offic accus murder presum insan kurtz armi cross border cambodia set god among local tribe secret mission willard confront horror hypocrisi push colonel kurtz edg abyss insan primal violenc human natur dark heart film note problem encount make chronicl documentari heart dark filmmak apocalyps problem includ brando arriv set overweight complet unprepar expens set destroy sever weather sheen breakdown suffer heart attack locat problem continu product releas postpon sever time coppola edit thousand foot film apocalyps honor palm cann film festiv nomin academi award best pictur golden globe award best motion pictur drama initi review mix sever critic found coppola handl stori major theme anticlimact intellectu disappoint howev subsequ year apocalyps today consid one greatest film ever made rank sight sound greatest film poll film select preserv nation film registri librari congress cultur histor aesthet signific,C1

128,Eid al fitr,"Eid al-Fitr is a Muslim holiday that marks the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting (sawm). Eid is an Arabic word meaning ""festivity"", while Fiṭr means ""to break fast""; and so the holiday symbolizes the breaking of the fasting period. It is celebrated after the end of the Islamic month of Ramadan, on the first day of Shawwal.
Eid al-Fitr is sometimes also known as the ""Smaller Eid"" as compared to the Eid al-Adha that lasts three days following the Hajj (the pilgrimage to Mecca) and is casually referred to as the ""Greater Eid""
At the end of Ramadan every Muslim is required to pay Zakat al-Fitr (a special fast breaking alm) as a token of thankfulness to God for having enabled him or her to observe the obligatory fast.
Typically, on the day of the al eid Muslims generally greet each other have a small breakfast before attending a special Eid prayer that is performed in congregation at mosques or open areas like fields, squares etc. Muslims are encouraged to dress in their best clothes (new if possible) for the occasion.",eid muslim holiday mark end ramadan islam holi month fast sawm eid arab word mean festiv fiṭr mean break fast holiday symbol break fast period celebr end islam month ramadan first day shawwal eid sometim also known smaller eid compar eid last three day follow hajj pilgrimag mecca casual refer greater eid end ramadan everi muslim requir pay zakat special fast break alm token thank god enabl observ obligatori fast typic day al eid muslim gener greet small breakfast attend special eid prayer perform congreg mosqu open area like field squar etc muslim encourag dress best cloth new possibl occas,B1
129,Romeo and juliet themes,"The themes of Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare are various but the most salient feature of the story is the theme of love. The play presents the most famous love story in the English literary tradition. But although love is naturally the play's dominant and most important theme, other themes are also present throughout the events.
Here are the main themes of Romeo and Juliet.
Romeo and Juliet is sometimes considered to have no unifying theme, save that of young love. The play focuses on romantic love, mainly the intense passion that springs up at first sight between Romeo and Juliet. Love in this play is a violent and ecstatic that has power over all other social values. It is also a tragic love and Romeo and Juliet have become emblematic of young lovers and doomed love.
Scholars are divided on the role of fate in the play. No consensus exists on whether the characters are truly fated to die together or whether the events take place by a series of unlucky chances. Arguments in favor of fate often refer to the description of the lovers as ""star-cross'd"". This phrase seems to hint that the stars have predetermined the lovers' future
Shakespeare's widespread use of light and dark imagery throughout the play has long been noted. The theme of light is considered as ""symbolic of the natural beauty of young love."" Both Romeo and Juliet see the other as light in a surrounding darkness. Romeo describes Juliet as being like the sun, brighter than a torch, a jewel sparkling in the night, and a bright angel among dark clouds. Even when she lies apparently dead in the tomb, he says her ""beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light."" Juliet describes Romeo as ""day in night"" and ""Whiter than snow upon a raven's back."" This contrast of light and dark can be expanded as symbols—contrasting love and hate, youth and age in a metaphoric way.
Time plays an important role in the language and plot of the play. Both Romeo and Juliet struggle to maintain an imaginary world void of time in the face of the harsh realities that surround them. For instance, when Romeo swears his love to Juliet by the moon, she protests ""O swear not by the moon, th'inconstant moon, / That monthly changes in her circled orb, / Lest that thy love prove likewise variable."" From the very beginning, the lovers are designated as ""star-cross'd"" referring to an astrological belief associated with time. Stars were thought to control the fates of humanity, and as time passed, stars would move along their course in the sky, also charting the course of human lives below. Romeo speaks of a foreboding he feels in the stars' movements early in the play, and when he learns of Juliet's death, he defies the stars' course for him.",theme romeo juliet william shakespear variou salient featur stori theme love play present famou love stori english literari tradit although love natur play domin import theme theme also present throughout event main theme romeo juliet romeo juliet sometim consid unifi theme save young love play focus romant love mainli intens passion spring first sight romeo juliet love play violent ecstat power social valu also tragic love romeo juliet becom emblemat young lover doom love scholar divid role fate play consensu exist whether charact truli fate die togeth whether event take place seri unlucki chanc argument favor fate often refer descript lover phrase seem hint star predetermin lover futur shakespear widespread use light dark imageri throughout play long note theme light consid symbol natur beauti young love romeo juliet see light surround dark romeo describ juliet like sun brighter torch jewel sparkl night bright angel among dark cloud even lie appar dead tomb say beauti make vault feast presenc full light juliet describ romeo day night whiter snow upon raven back contrast light dark expand love hate youth age metaphor way time play import role languag plot play romeo juliet struggl maintain imaginari world void time face harsh realiti surround instanc romeo swear love juliet moon protest swear moon moon monthli chang circl orb lest thi love prove likewis variabl begin lover design refer astrolog belief associ time star thought control fate human time pas star would move along cours sky also chart cours human live romeo speak forebod feel star movement earli play learn juliet death defi star cours,B1
130,Australia day,"Australia Day is an official celabration that commemorates the anniversary of the 1788 arrival of the First Fleet of British Ships at Sydney Cove, New South Wales, and raising of the Flag of Great Britain at that site by Governor Arthur Phillip. It is celebrated annually on 26 January and is variously referred to as the Anniversary Day, Invasion Day, Foundation Day, and ANA (Australian Natives' Association) Day.
Although it was not known as Australia Day until over a century later, records of celebrations on 26 January date back to 1808. A century later the celebration was officially recognized when in 1908 the British colonies of Australia formed a Federation, marking the birth of modern Australia. It was not until 1935 that all Australian states and territories had adopted use of the term Australia Day to mark the date, and not until 1994 that the date was consistently marked by a public holiday by all states and territories.
Outdoor concerts, community barbecues, sports competitions, festivals and fireworks are some of the many events presented in communities across Australia for this occasion. These official events are presented by the National Australia Day Council, an official council or committee in each state and territory, and local committees. The celebration is also marked by the announcement of the Australian of the Year Awards. This celebrates the achievements and contributions of eminent Australians, both young and old, in all fields from science to sport.",australia day offici celabr commemor anniversari arriv first fleet british ship sydney cove new south wale rais flag great britain site governor arthur phillip celebr annual januari various refer anniversari day invas day foundat day ana australian nativ associ day although known australia day centuri later record celebr januari date back centuri later celebr offici recogn british coloni australia form feder mark birth modern australia australian state territori adopt use term australia day mark date date consist mark public holiday state territori outdoor concert commun barbecu sport competit festiv firework mani event present commun across australia occas offici event present nation australia day council offici council committe state territori local committe celebr also mark announc australian year award celebr achiev contribut emin australian young old field scienc sport,C1

132,Culture shock experiences,"Culture shock can be a daunting experience. It might cause depressive and anxious symptoms, but it might also be an enriching experience as it allows you to become aware of how diverse are the cultures of the world and as a result leads one to develop tolerance towards the differences between the different countries. Besides, culture shock provides you with the opportunity to gain a better understanding of your own cultural awareness, stand back from yourself, and become aware of your own culture, values, beliefs, and perceptions.
The following are examples of culture shock experiences, reported by travelers around the world.
""I’m the kind of person who eats a pizza and sometimes even a sandwich with cutlery. So, using nothing more than my fingers and some chapati to eat curry took some getting used to.""
Jo Fitzsimons
""I didn't speak any Japanese. I took some lessons at my exchange university and picked up a few basic phrases, but with a completely different alphabet, it can be tricky to get around places and buy items. Japan is quite rare in that hardly anybody actually speaks any English, so a lot of interpretive sign language was required.""
Kevin Seidler
""None of my friends back in India believed me when I told them that you can literally buy anything, including food, and return it within ninety days for a full refund even if you don't have a specific reason for doing so. Most stores actually have a 'Buyer's Remorse' category under Reason for Return options while returning the product.""
Aniruddh Chaturvedi
""You would think that Poland (the country that I’m from) and the UK shouldn’t be very different when it comes to the culture, I couldn’t be more wrong. Where do I start? For example –“small talk”. It just doesn't exist in Poland. We do not talk to strangers and ask them what they have for dinner. Why would you even want to know that? I remember how surprised I was, when whilst shopping, I was approached by the shop assistant and asked about my personal life and plans for the evening.""

133,Walt disney,"Walt Disney was born on December 5, 1901. Disney became one of the best-known motion picture producers in the world. He is particularly noted for being a film producer and a popular showman, as well as an innovator in animation and theme park design.
Disney is famous for his contributions in the field of entertainment during the 20th century. His first success was through the series, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit which was created by the Disney studio for Charles Mintz of Universal Studios. When Disney asked for a larger budget for his popular Oswald series, Mintz refused and Disney had to quit. Later, Disney and his brother Roy O. Disney started from scratch and co-founded Walt Disney Productions, now known as The Walt Disney Company. Today, this company has annual revenues of approximately U.S. $35 billion. This succes is largely due to a number of the world's most famous fictional characters he and his staff created including Mickey Mouse, a character for which Disney himself was the original voice.
Disney won 26 Academy Awards out of 59 nominations, including a record four in one year, giving him more awards and nominations than any other individual. He is also the namesake for Disneyland and Walt Disney World Resort theme parks in the United States, as well as the international resorts in Japan, France, and China.
Disney died of lung cancer in Burbank, California, on December 15, 1966. The following year, construction began on Walt Disney World Resort in Florida.

134,Lionel messi,"Lionel Andraos Messi , born on 24 June 1987, is an Argentine footballer who currently plays for Barcelona and the Argentine national team. He is one of the best football players of his generation and is frequently considered as the world's best contemporary player. Lionel Messi, whose playing style and ability have drawn comparisons to Diego Maradona, received Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year nominations by the age of 21 and won both by the age of 22. Diego Maradona once declared that Messi was his ""successor.""
Lionel Messi's talent was early detected by his father. When he began playing with the local team, his potential was quickly identified by Barcelona . At the age of 11, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency, which is a medical condition in which the body does not produce enough growth hormone and whose treatment nessecitates a lot of money. He left Rosario-based Newell's Old Boys's youth team in 2000 and moved with his family to Europe, as Barcelona offered treatment for his growth hormone deficiency. Making his debut in the 2004â€“05 season, he broke the La Liga record for the youngest footballer to play a league game, and also the youngest to score a league goal. Major honours soon followed as Barcelona won La Liga in Messi's debut season, and won a double of the league and Champions League in 2006. His breakthrough season was in 2006â€“07; he became a first team regular, scoring a hat-trick in El ClÃ¡sico and finishing with 14 goals in 26 league games. Perhaps his most successful season was the 2008â€“09 season, in which Messi scored 38 goals to play an integral part in a treble-winning campaign.
Messi was the top scorer of the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship with six goals, including two in the final game. Shortly thereafter, he became an established member of Argentina's senior international team. In 2006, he became the youngest Argentine to play in the FIFA World Cup and he won a runners-up medal at the Copa AmÃ©rica tournament the following year. In 2008, in Beijing, he won his first international honour, an Olympic gold medal, with the Argentina Olympic football team.",lionel andrao messi born june argentin footbal current play barcelona argentin nation team one best footbal player gener frequent consid world best contemporari player lionel messi whose play style abil drawn comparison diego maradona receiv ballon fifa world player year nomin age age diego maradona declar messi successor lionel messi talent earli detect father began play local team potenti quickli identifi barcelona age diagnos growth hormon defici medic condit bodi produc enough growth hormon whose treatment nessecit lot money left newel old boy youth team move famili europ barcelona offer treatment growth hormon defici make debut season broke la liga record youngest footbal play leagu game also youngest score leagu goal major honour soon follow barcelona la liga messi debut season doubl leagu champion leagu breakthrough season becam first team regular score el finish goal leagu game perhap success season season messi score goal play integr part campaign messi top scorer fifa world youth championship six goal includ two final game shortli thereaft becam establish member argentina senior intern team becam youngest argentin play fifa world cup medal copa tournament follow year beij first intern honour olymp gold medal argentina olymp footbal team,B2
135,Snakes,"Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles that can be distinguished from legless lizards by their lack of eyelids and external ears. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung.
Living snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica, and on most smaller land masses; exceptions include some large islands, such as Ireland, Iceland, Greenland, the Hawaiian archipelago, and the islands of New Zealand, and many small islands of the Atlantic and central Pacific oceans. Additionally, sea snakes are widespread throughout the Indian and Pacific Oceans. More than 20 families are currently recognized. They range in size from the tiny, 10.4 cm (4.1 in)-long thread snake to the reticulated python of 6.95 meters (22.8 ft) in length. The fossil species Titanoboa cerrejonensis was 12.8 meters (42 ft) long. Snakes are thought to have evolved from either burrowing or aquatic lizards, perhaps during the Jurassic period.
Most species are nonvenomous and those that have venom use it primarily to kill and subdue prey rather than for self-defense. Some possess venom potent enough to cause painful injury or death to humans. The colloquial term ""poisonous snake"" is generally an incorrect label for snakes. A poison is inhaled or ingested, whereas venom produced by snakes is injected into its victim via fangs. It is worthwhile noting that certain birds, mammals, and other snakes (such as kingsnakes) that prey on venomous snakes have developed resistance and even immunity to certain venoms. Nonvenomous snakes either swallow prey alive or kill by constriction.
All snakes are strictly carnivorous, eating small animals including lizards, frogs, other snakes, small mammals, birds, eggs, fish, snails or insects. Because snakes cannot bite or tear their food to pieces, they must swallow prey whole. The body size of a snake has a major influence on its eating habits. Smaller snakes eat smaller prey. Juvenile pythons might start out feeding on lizards or mice and graduate to small deer or antelope as an adult, for example. After eating, snakes become dormant while the process of digestion takes place.",snake elong legless carnivor reptil distinguish legless lizard lack eyelid extern ear mani speci snake skull sever joint lizard ancestor enabl swallow prey much larger head highli mobil jaw accommod narrow bodi snake pair organ kidney appear one front instead side side one function lung live snake found everi contin except antarctica smaller land mass except includ larg island ireland iceland greenland hawaiian archipelago island new zealand mani small island atlant central pacif ocean addit sea snake widespread throughout indian pacif ocean famili current recogn rang size tini cm thread snake reticul python meter ft length fossil speci titanoboa cerrejonensi meter ft long snake thought evolv either burrow aquat lizard perhap jurass period speci nonvenom venom use primarili kill subdu prey rather posse venom potent enough caus pain injuri death human colloqui term poison snake gener incorrect label snake poison inhal ingest wherea venom produc snake inject victim via fang worthwhil note certain bird mammal snake kingsnak prey venom snake develop resist even immun certain venom nonvenom snake either swallow prey aliv kill constrict snake strictli carnivor eat small anim includ lizard frog snake small mammal bird egg fish snail insect snake bite tear food piec must swallow prey whole bodi size snake major influenc eat habit smaller snake eat smaller prey juvenil python might start feed lizard mouse graduat small deer antelop adult exampl eat snake becom dormant process digest take place,B2
136,Antica pizzeria port alba,"First established in 1738 as a stand for peddlers, Antica Pizzeria Port'Alba was opened in 1830 in the town center at Via Port'Alba 18, Naples, Italy. It is is widely believed to be the world's first pizzeria
The restaurant replaced street vendors who would make pizza in wood-fired ovens and bring it onto the street, keeping it warm in small tin stoves they balanced on their head. It soon became a prominent meeting place for men in the street. Most patrons were artists, students, or others with very little money, so the pizzas made were generally simple, with toppings such as oil and garlic. A payment system, called pizza a otto, was developed that allowed customers to pay up to eight days after their meal. A resulting local joke was that a meal from Port'Alba might be someone's last free meal, if they died before they paid. Additionally, patrons created poetry to honor the pizzas.
Antica Pizzeria Port'Alba is still in business today, located between a number of bookstores.

137,Nelson mandela,"Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (also known as Madiba), a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary and politician who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999, was the first black South African to hold the office, and the first elected in a fully representative, multiracial election. Mandela was born to the Thembu royal family. He attended Fort Hare University and the University of Witwatersrand where he studied law. After the Afrikaner nationalists of the National Party came to power in 1948 and began implementing the policy of apartheid, a system of racial segragation, he rose to prominence in the the African National Congress's 1952 Defiance Campaign. Working as a lawyer, he was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and, with the ANC leadership, was prosecuted in the Treason Trial from 1956 to 1961 but was found not guilty. Although initially committed to non-violent protest, he was arrested in 1962, convicted of sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government, and sentenced to life imprisonment in the Rivonia Trial.
An international campaign lobbied for his release, which was granted in 1990 after 27 years of imprisonment. Becoming ANC President, Mandela led negotiations with President F.W. de Klerk to abolish apartheid and establish multi-racial elections in 1994, in which he led the ANC to victory. He was elected President and formed a Government of National Unity. As President, he established a new constitution and initiated the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses, while introducing policies to encourage land reform, combat poverty and expand healthcare services.",nelson rolihlahla mandela also known madiba south african revolutionari politician serv presid south africa first black south african hold offic first elect fulli repres multiraci elect mandela born thembu royal famili attend fort hare univers univers witwatersrand studi law afrikan nationalist nation parti came power began implement polici apartheid system racial segrag rose promin african nation congress defianc campaign work lawyer repeatedli arrest sediti activ anc leadership prosecut treason trial found guilti although initi commit protest arrest convict sabotag conspiraci overthrow govern sentenc life imprison rivonia trial intern campaign lobbi releas grant year imprison becom anc presid mandela led negoti presid de klerk abolish apartheid establish elect led anc victori elect presid form govern nation uniti presid establish new constitut initi truth reconcili commiss investig past human right abus introduc polici encourag land reform combat poverti expand healthcar servic,C1
138,Rowan atkinson,"The English actor, comedian, and screenwriter, Rowan Sebastian Atkinson, was born on 6 January 1955 in Consett, County Durham, England. He is best known for his work on the sitcoms Mr. Bean and Blackadder. Atkinson has been listed in The Observer as one of the 50 funniest actors in British comedy and amongst the top 50 comedians ever, in a 2005 poll of fellow comedians.
Atkinson got a master's degree in Electrical Engineering at The Queen's College, Oxford. While studying at Oxford Atkinson started writing and performing his first sketches. He first appeared in Oxford revues at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Later, he started performing in theater clubs and on comedy shows for BBC Radio 3. He reached success in TV performances such as Not the Nine O'Clock News (1979-82), Blackadder (1983-89) and The Thin Blue Line (1995-96), but Atkinson reached worldwide fame by writing and starring the TV sitcom Mr. Bean (1990-95). Described by Atkinson himself Mr Bean is a character that is much like ""a child in a grown man's body"".

139,Education,"Education encompasses both the teaching and learning of knowledge, proper conduct, and technical competency. It thus focuses on the cultivation of skills, trades or professions, as well as mental, moral & aesthetic development.
Formal education consists of systematic instruction, teaching and training by professional teachers. This consists of the application of pedagogy and the development of curricula.
The right to education is a fundamental human right. Since 1952, Article 2 of the first Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights obliges all signatory parties to guarantee the right to education. At world level, the United Nations' International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1966 guarantees this right under its Article 13.
Educational systems are established to provide education and training, often for children and the young. A curriculum defines what students should know, understand and be able to do as the result of education. A teaching profession delivers teaching which enables learning, and a system of policies, regulations, examinations, structures and funding enables teachers to teach to the best of their abilities. Sometimes educational systems can be used to promote doctrines or ideals as well as knowledge, which is known as social engineering. This can lead to political abuse of the system, particularly in totalitarian states and government.
Primary (or elementary) education consists of the first years of formal, structured education. In general, primary education consists of six or seven years of schooling starting at the age of 5 or 6, although this varies between, and sometimes within, countries. Globally, around 70% of primary-age children are enrolled in primary education, and this proportion is rising.
In most contemporary educational systems of the world, secondary education consists of the second years of formal education that occur during adolescence.It is characterized by transition from the typically compulsory, comprehensive primary education for minors, to the optional, selective tertiary, ""post-secondary"", or ""higher"" education (e.g., university, vocational school) for adults.
Higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or post secondary education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school providing a secondary education, such as a high school or secondary school. Tertiary education is normally taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education, as well as vocational education and training. Colleges and universities are the main institutions that provide tertiary education. Collectively, these are sometimes known as tertiary institutions. Tertiary education generally results in the receipt of certificates, diplomas, or academic degrees.",educ encompass teach learn knowledg proper conduct technic compet thu focus cultiv skill trade profess well mental moral aesthet develop formal educ consist systemat instruct teach train profession teacher consist applic pedagogi develop curriculum right educ fundament human right sinc articl first protocol european convent human right oblig signatori parti guarante right educ world level unit nation intern coven econom social cultur right guarante right articl educ system establish provid educ train often child young curriculum defin student know understand abl result educ teach profess deliv teach enabl learn system polici regul examin structur fund enabl teacher teach best abil sometim educ system use promot doctrin ideal well knowledg known social engin lead polit abus system particularli totalitarian state govern primari elementari educ consist first year formal structur educ gener primari educ consist six seven year school start age although vari sometim within countri global around child enrol primari educ proport rise contemporari educ system world secondari educ consist second year formal educ occur character transit typic compulsori comprehens primari educ minor option select tertiari higher educ univers vocat school adult higher educ also call tertiari third stage post secondari educ educ level follow complet school provid secondari educ high school secondari school tertiari educ normal taken includ undergradu postgradu educ well vocat educ train colleg univers main institut provid tertiari educ collect sometim known tertiari institut tertiari educ gener result receipt certif diploma academ degre,B2
140,World water day,"World Water Day is observed on March 22 since 1993. It was declared as such by the United Nations General Assembly. This day was first formally proposed in Agenda 21 of the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Observance began in 1993 and has grown significantly ever since.
The UN and its member nations devote this day to implementing UN recommendations and promoting concrete activities within their countries regarding the world's water resources. Each year, one of various UN agencies involved in water issues takes the lead in promoting and coordinating international activities for World Water Day.
In addition to the UN member states, a number of NGOs promoting clean water and sustainable aquatic habitats have used World Day for Water as a time to focus public attention on the critical water issues of our era. Every three years since 1997, for instance, the World Water Council has drawn thousands to participate in its World Water Forum during the week of World Day for Water. Participating agencies and NGOs have highlighted issues such as a billion people being without access to safe water for drinking and the role of gender in family access to safe water.",world water day observ march sinc declar unit nation gener assembl day first formal propos agenda unit nation confer environ develop unc rio de janeiro brazil observ began grown significantli ever sinc un member nation devot day implement un recommend promot concret activ within countri regard world water resourc year one variou un agenc involv water issu take lead promot coordin intern activ world water day addit un member state number ngo promot clean water sustain aquat habitat use world day water time focu public attent critic water issu era everi three year sinc instanc world water council drawn thousand particip world water forum week world day water particip agenc ngo highlight issu billion peopl without access safe water drink role gender famili access safe water,C1
141,Joseph conrad biography,"Joseph Conrad was a Polish-British writer. He was born on December 3 in 1857. He is regarded as one of the greatest novelists to write in the English language. He was granted British nationality in 1886 but always considered himself a Pole. Though he did not speak English fluently until he was in his twenties (and always with a marked accent), he was a master prose stylist who brought a distinctly non-English sensibility into English literature. He wrote stories and novels, many with a nautical setting, that depict trials of the human spirit in the midst of an impassive, inscrutable universe.
Joseph Conrad is considered an early modernist, though his works still contain elements of nineteenth-century realism. His narrative style and anti-heroic characters have influenced many authors, including T.S. Eliot, William Faulkner and Graham Greene. Many films have been adapted from, or inspired by, Conrad's works. One of the most famous adaptations of his work is Apocalypse Now (1979), by Francis Ford Coppola. It was adapted from Heart of Darkness.
Writing in the heyday of the British Empire, Conrad drew on his native Poland's national experiences and on his personal experiences in the French and British merchant navies to create short stories and novels that reflect aspects of a European-dominated world, while profoundly exploring human psychology. Appreciated early on by literary critics, his fiction and nonfiction have since been seen as almost prophetic, in the light of subsequent national and international disasters of the 20th and 21st centuries

142,Difference african asian elephants,"Both African and Asian elephants are descendants of the same family, Elephantidae, but they are of different genus. The African elephant belongs to the Loxodonta africana genus while the Asian elephant belong to the Elephas maximus genus.
African and Asian elephants may look similar but there are basic differences.
African elephants have larger ears reaching the size of the animal's whole head. Asian elephants have smaller ears.
The African elephant is much larger, averaging 3,600–6,000 kilograms (8,000–13,200 lbs.) Asian males weigh between 3000-6,000 kilograms (6,600–11,000 lbs.)
The back of an African elephant has a defined slope, while the Asian elephant has a flatter back.
Both male and female African elephants have tusks. However, only some Asian male elephants have tusks which are noticeably smaller than those of the African elephants.
The African elephant's trunk is equipped with two ""fingers"". These allow it to grasp onto leaves and grasses before bringing them to its mouth. Asian elephants trunk, however has only one ""finger"". They use this single ""finger"" to curl around food, which they then squeeze up into their mouths.

Asian elephants have a distinctly humped skull.",african asian eleph descend famili elephantida differ genu african eleph belong loxodonta africana genu asian eleph belong elepha maximu genu african asian eleph may look similar basic differ african eleph larger ear reach size anim whole head asian eleph smaller ear african eleph much larger averag kilogram lb asian male weigh kilogram lb back african eleph defin slope asian eleph flatter back male femal african eleph tusk howev asian male eleph tusk notic smaller african eleph african eleph trunk equip two finger allow grasp onto leav grass bring mouth asian eleph trunk howev one finger use singl finger curl around food squeez mouth african eleph asian eleph distinctli hump skull,A2
143,Bob marley,"Bob Marley, was born on February 6, 1945. He was a Jamaican reggae singer, songwriter, musician, and guitarist who achieved international fame and acclaim. Starting out in 1963 with the group The Wailers, he forged a distinctive songwriting and vocal style that would later resonate with audiences worldwide. After The Wailers disbanded in 1974, Marley pursued a solo career that culminated in the release of the album Exodus in 1977, which established his worldwide reputation and produced his status as one of the world's best-selling artists of all time, with sales of more than 75 million records.
Bob Marley was a committed Rastafari, an Abrahamic religion which developed in Jamaica in the 1930s.This religion infused his music with a sense of spirituality. The Rastafari movement was a key element in the development of reggae. As an ardent proponent of Rastafari, Bob Marley took the reggae music out of the socially deprived areas of Jamaica and onto the international music scene.
In July 1977, Marley was found to have a type of malignant melanoma under the nail of a toe. Marley turned down his doctors' advice to have his toe amputated, citing his religious beliefs. Despite his illness, he continued touring until his health deteriorated as the cancer had spread throughout his body. He died on 11 May 1981 at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Miami (now University of Miami Hospital) at the age of 36. The spread of melanoma to his lungs and brain caused his death.

144,Anorexia,"Anorexia is an eating disorder which is characterized by unusually low body weight, food self-deprivation, a severe fear of gaining weight, and a craving to be thin. Even though people suffering from anorexia are underweight, they consider themselves as obese. Anorexic people are often in self-denial concerning their low body weight.
As a consequence, anorexia may lead to severe health problems. 
Psychologically, people suffering from anorexia are often depressed.
The causes of anorexia are not clearly identified. Specialists recognize that there are at least two types of factors that lead to this type of eating disorder, namely genetic predisposition and cultural factors. It has been proven, for example, that identical twins are more often affected than non-identical ones. Besides, It seems that anorexia is more widely spread in societies that highly value thinness. Also, this eating disorder occurs more often among those people who are involved in careers such as modeling, athletic performance, and dancing.
The treatment of anorexia is threefold: medical, nutritional and psychological. The primary focus is to address any serious health problem that may have emerged from the eating disorder such as amenorrhea, malnutrition, and an unstable heartbeat. Additionally, the treatment focuses on restoring weight to its healthy level through the implementation and supervision of a personalized diet and education about normal eating patterns. Patients have also to undergo a therapy that aims at recognizing the primary issues related to the eating disorder. The therapy also involves addressing and healing from traumatic life events. In addition to that, patients have to learn healthier strategies and coping skills. Finally, medications may be used to help with associated anxiety or depression.",anorexia eat disord character unusu low bodi weight food sever fear gain weight crave thin even though peopl suffer anorexia underweight consid obes anorex peopl often concern low bodi weight consequ anorexia may lead sever health problem psycholog peopl suffer anorexia often depress caus anorexia clearli identifi specialist recogn least two type factor lead type eat disord name genet predisposit cultur factor proven exampl ident twin often affect one besid seem anorexia wide spread societi highli valu thin also eat disord occur often among peopl involv career model athlet perform danc treatment anorexia threefold medic nutrit psycholog primari focu address seriou health problem may emerg eat disord amenorrhea malnutrit unstabl heartbeat addit treatment focus restor weight healthi level implement supervis person diet educ normal eat pattern patient also undergo therapi aim recogn primari issu relat eat disord therapi also involv address heal traumat life event addit patient learn healthier strategi cope skill final medic may use help associ anxieti depress,B2
145,Rosa parks,"Rosa Louise McCauley Parks was born on February 4, 1913 and died on October 24, 2005. She was an African-American civil and was called ""the first lady of civil rights"", and ""the mother of the freedom movement"".
Rosa Parks' first event in her fight for civil rights was in Montgomery, Alabama. On December 1, 1955, Parks refused to obey bus driver James Blake's order that she give up her seat to make room for a white passenger. This disobedience and defiance had the effect of sparking the Montgomery Bus Boycott. It became an important symbol of the modern Civil Rights Movement and Parks became an international icon of resistance to racial segregation. She organized and collaborated with civil rights leaders, including boycott leader Martin Luther King, Jr., helping to launch him to national prominence in the civil rights movement.
Although widely honored in later years for her action, she suffered for it, losing her job as a seamstress in a local department store. Eventually, she moved to Detroit, Michigan, where she found similar work. From 1965 to 1988 she served as secretary and receptionist to African-American U.S. Representative John Conyers. After retirement from this position, she wrote an autobiography and lived a largely private life in Detroit. In her final years she suffered from dementia, and became involved in a lawsuit filed on her behalf against American hip-hop duo OutKast.
Parks eventually received many honors ranging from the 1979 Spingarn Medal to the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal and a posthumous statue in the United States Capitol's National Statuary Hall. Her death in 2005 was a major story in the United States' leading newspapers. She was granted the posthumous honor of lying in honor at the Capitol Rotunda.",rosa louis mccauley park born februari die octob civil call first ladi civil right mother freedom movement rosa park first event fight civil right montgomeri alabama decemb park refus obey bu driver jame blake order give seat make room white passeng disobedi defianc effect spark montgomeri bu boycott becam import symbol modern civil right movement park becam intern icon resist racial segreg organ collabor civil right leader includ boycott leader martin luther king help launch nation promin civil right movement although wide honor later year action suffer lose job seamstress local depart store eventu move detroit michigan found similar work serv secretari receptionist repres john conyer retir posit wrote autobiographi live larg privat life detroit final year suffer dementia becam involv lawsuit file behalf american duo outkast park eventu receiv mani honor rang spingarn medal presidenti medal freedom congression gold medal posthum statu unit state capitol nation statuari hall death major stori unit state lead newspap grant posthum honor lie honor capitol rotunda,B2
146,Brief history of time by hawking,"""A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes"" is one of Stephen Hawking's bestsellers. It is a popular-science book on cosmology. Hawking first published the book in 1988 with the intention to explain difficult theoretical concepts to laymen.
Because Hawking wrote A Brief History of Time for nonspecialist readers with no prior knowledge of scientific theories, he used non-technical terms about the structure, origin, development and eventual fate of the universe, which is the object of study of astronomy and modern physics.
Throughout the chapters of the book, Hawking explains basic concepts like space and time, basic building blocks that make up the universe (such as quarks) and the fundamental forces that govern it (such as gravity). He also writes about cosmological phenomena such as the Big Bang and black holes. Professor Hawking also discusses two major theories that modern scientists use to describe the universe, namely general relativity and quantum mechanics. Finally, the book also discusses the search for a unifying theory that describes everything in the universe in a coherent manner. Recent advances in science have confirmed many of Professor Hawking's theoretical predictions in the first edition of this book.
The book became a bestseller and sold more than 10 million copies in 20 years. It was also on the London Sunday Times bestseller list for more than five years and was translated into 35 languages by 2001.",brief histori time big bang black hole one stephen hawk bestsel book cosmolog hawk first publish book intent explain difficult theoret concept layman hawk wrote brief histori time nonspecialist reader prior knowledg scientif theori use term structur origin develop eventu fate univers object studi astronomi modern physic throughout chapter book hawk explain basic concept like space time basic build block make univers quark fundament forc govern graviti also write cosmolog phenomenon big bang black hole professor hawk also discus two major theori modern scientist use describ univers name gener rel quantum mechan final book also discus search unifi theori describ everyth univers coher manner recent advanc scienc confirm mani professor hawk theoret predict first edit book book becam bestsel sold million copi year also london sunday time bestsel list five year translat languag,B2
147,Maya civilization,"The Maya civilization was a Mesoamerican civilization developed by the Maya peoples in an area that encompasses southeastern Mexico, all of Guatemala and Belize, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador. The Maya civilization is known for the Maya hieroglyphic script, the only known fully developed writing system of the pre-Columbian Americas, as well as for its art, architecture, and mathematical and astronomical systems.
The Maya civilization developed from the the Archaic period, prior to 2000 BC, to the fall of the last Maya city in 1697 by the Spanish Empire. Classic period rule was centered around the concept of the ""divine king"", who acted as a mediator between mortals and the supernatural realm. Kingship was patrilineal, and power would normally pass to the eldest son. A prospective king was also expected to be a successful war leader. Maya politics was dominated by a closed system of patronage, although the exact political make-up of a kingdom varied from city-state to city-state. By the Late Classic, the aristocracy had greatly increased, resulting in the corresponding reduction in the exclusive power of the divine king. As a part of their religion, the Maya practiced human sacrifice.
The Maya civilisation developed highly sophisticated artforms, and the Maya created art using both perishable and non-perishable materials, including wood, jade, obsidian, ceramics, sculpted stone monuments, stucco, and finely painted murals.
Maya cities tended to expand haphazardly, and the city center would be occupied by commercial and administrative complexes, surrounded by an irregular sprawl of residential districts. Different parts of a city would often be linked by causeways, a sort of paved roads. The principal architecture of the city consisted of palaces, pyramid-temples, ceremonial ballcourts, and structures aligned for astronomical observation.
The Maya elite were literate, and developed a complex system of hieroglyphic writing that was the most advanced in the pre-Columbian Americas. The Maya recorded their history and ritual knowledge in screenfold books, of which only three uncontested examples remain, the rest having been destroyed by the Spanish. There are also a great many examples of Maya text found on ceramics and stelae, a kind of monuments that consist of tall sculpted stone shafts. The Maya developed a highly complex series of interlocking ritual calendars, and employed mathematics that included one of the earliest instances of the explicit zero in the world.",maya civil mesoamerican civil develop maya peopl area encompass southeastern mexico guatemala beliz western portion hondura el salvador maya civil known maya hieroglyph script known fulli develop write system america well art architectur mathemat astronom system maya civil develop archaic period prior bc fall last maya citi spanish empir classic period rule center around concept divin king act mediat mortal supernatur realm kingship patrilin power would normal pas eldest son prospect king also expect success war leader maya polit domin close system patronag although exact polit kingdom vari late classic aristocraci greatli increas result correspond reduct exclus power divin king part religion maya practic human sacrific maya civilis develop highli sophist artform maya creat art use perish materi includ wood jade obsidian ceram sculpt stone monument stucco fine paint mural maya citi tend expand haphazardli citi center would occupi commerci administr complex surround irregular sprawl residenti district differ part citi would often link causeway sort pave road princip architectur citi consist palac ceremoni ballcourt structur align astronom observ maya elit liter develop complex system hieroglyph write advanc america maya record histori ritual knowledg screenfold book three uncontest exampl remain rest destroy spanish also great mani exampl maya text found ceram stela kind monument consist tall sculpt stone shaft maya develop highli complex seri interlock ritual calendar employ mathemat includ one earliest instanc explicit zero world,C2
148,Victorian era,"The British Victorian era was the period of Queen Victoria's reign from 20 June 1837 until her death, on 22 January 1901. It was a long period of peace, prosperity, ""refined sensibilities"" and national self-confidence for Britain.
Historians have characterized the mid-Victorian era, (1850–1870) as Britain's 'Golden Years.' There was prosperity, as the national income per person grew by half. Much of the prosperity was due to the increasing industrialization, especially in textiles and machinery, as well as to the worldwide network of trade and engineering that produced profits for British merchants, and exports from across the globe.
Industrialization brought with it a rapidly growing middle class whose increase in numbers had a significant effect on the social strata itself: cultural norms, lifestyle, values and morality. Identifiable characteristics came to define the middle class home and lifestyle. Previously, in town and city, residential space was adjacent to or incorporated into the work site, virtually occupying the same geographical space. As Kate Summerscale (2009) noted, ""The English home closed up and darkened over the decade (1850s), the cult of domesticity matched by a cult of privacy."" Bourgeois existence was a world of interior space, heavily curtained off and wary of intrusion, and opened only by invitation for viewing on occasions such as parties or teas.
While in the preceding Romantic period poetry had been the dominant genre, it was the novel that was most important in the Victorian period. Charles Dickens (1812–1870) dominated the first part of Victoria's reign: his first novel, Pickwick Papers, was published in 1836, and his last Our Mutual Friend between 1864–5. Other famous novelist include William Thackeray (1811–1863), the three Brontë sisters, Charlotte (1816–55), Emily (1818–48) and Anne (1820–49), George Eliot (1819–80) and Thomas Hardy (1840–1928).
Robert Browning (1812–89) and Alfred Tennyson (1809–92) were Victorian England's most famous poets, though more recent taste has tended to prefer the poetry of Thomas Hardy. Early poetry of W. B. Yeats was also published in Victoria's reign.
With regard to the theater, it was not until the last decades of the nineteenth century that any significant works were produced. This began with Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas during the 1870s. In the 1890s various plays of George Bernard Shaw (1856–1950) were published. Finally, Oscar Wilde (1854–1900) wrote The Importance of Being Earnest in 1895.

149,Recycling,"Recycling can be defined as the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. It can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions. The aim of recycling is to avoid ""conventional"" waste disposal. It contributes to the prevention of the waste of potentially useful materials and reduces the consumption of fresh raw materials, thereby reducing: energy usage, air pollution (from incineration), and water pollution (from landfilling). This practice has been around throughout the history of mankind, with recorded advocates as far back as Plato in the fourth century BC.
Recycling is a key component of modern waste reduction and is the third component of the ""Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle"" waste hierarchy whose aim is to extract the maximum practical benefits from products and to generate the minimum amount of waste.
Recyclable materials include many kinds of glass, paper, and cardboard, metal, plastic, tires, textiles, and electronics. The composting or other reuse of biodegradable waste—such as food or garden waste—is also considered recycling.
Materials to be recycled are either brought to a collection center or picked up from the curbside, then sorted, cleaned, and reprocessed into new materials destined for manufacturing.
In the strictest sense, recycling of a material would produce a fresh supply of the same material—for example, used office paper would be converted into new office paper. However, this is often difficult or too expensive (compared with producing the same product from raw materials or other sources), so ""recycling"" of many products or materials involves their reuse in producing different materials (for example, paperboard) instead. Another form of recycling is the salvage of certain materials from complex products, either due to their intrinsic value (such as lead from car batteries, or gold from circuit boards) or due to their hazardous nature (e.g., removal and reuse of mercury from thermometers and thermostats).
Much of the difficulty inherent in recycling comes from the fact that most products are not designed with recycling in mind. The concept of sustainable design aims to solve this problem. Now scientists suggest that every product (and all packaging they require) should have a complete ""closed-loop"" cycle mapped out for each component—a way in which every component will either return to the natural ecosystem through biodegradation or be recycled indefinitely.",recycl defin process convert wast materi new materi object save materi help lower greenhous ga emiss aim recycl avoid convent wast dispos contribut prevent wast potenti use materi reduc consumpt fresh raw materi therebi reduc energi usag air pollut inciner water pollut landfil practic around throughout histori mankind record advoc far back plato fourth centuri bc recycl key compon modern wast reduct third compon reduc reus recycl wast hierarchi whose aim extract maximum practic benefit product gener minimum amount wast recycl materi includ mani kind glass paper cardboard metal plastic tire textil electron compost reus biodegrad food garden also consid recycl materi recycl either brought collect center pick curbsid sort clean reprocess new materi destin manufactur strictest sen recycl materi would produc fresh suppli exampl use offic paper would convert new offic paper howev often difficult expens compar produc product raw materi sourc recycl mani product materi involv reus produc differ materi exampl paperboard instead anoth form recycl salvag certain materi complex product either due intrins valu lead car batteri gold circuit board due hazard natur remov reus mercuri thermomet thermostat much difficulti inher recycl come fact product design recycl mind concept sustain design aim solv problem scientist suggest everi product packag requir complet cycl map way everi compon either return natur ecosystem biodegrad recycl indefinit,C1
150,Climate change,"Wikipedia defines climate as follows:
Climate encompasses the statistics of temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, rainfall, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological elements in a given region over a long period of time. Climate can be contrasted to weather, which is the present condition of these same elements and their variations over shorter time periods.
Climate may be inherently variable as evidenced by the irregularity of the seasons from one year to another. This variability is normal and may remain partially understood. It is related to changes in ocean currents, volcanic eruptions, solar radiation and other components of the climate system. In addition, our climate also has its extremes (such as floods, droughts, hail, tornadoes and hurricanes), which can be devastating. However, in recent decades, a number of indicators and studies show more and more evidence of climate warming across the globe. A disturbing phenomenon that challenges human habits and activities which are responsible for greenhouse gas emissions.
The greenhouse effect is the process by which absorption and emission of infrared radiation by gases in the atmosphere warm a planet's lower atmosphere and surface. It was proposed by Joseph Fourier in 1824 and was first investigated quantitatively by Svante Arrhenius in 1896.
Naturally occurring greenhouse gases have a mean warming effect of about 33 °C (59 °F). But Human activity since the Industrial Revolution has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to increased radiative forcing from CO2, methane, tropospheric ozone, CFCs (chlorofluorocarbon) and nitrous oxide. The concentrations of CO2 and methane have increased by 36% and 148% respectively since 1750. These levels are much higher than at any time during the last 650,000 years, the period for which reliable data has been extracted from ice cores. Over the last three decades of the 20th century, GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita and population growth were the main drivers of increases in greenhouse gas emissions. CO2 emissions are continuing to rise due to the burning of fossil fuels and land-use change.
There are two major effects of global warming: the increase of temperature on the earth by about 3Â° to 5Â° C (5.4Â° to 9Â° Fahrenheit) by the year 2100 and Rise of sea levels by at least 25 meters (82 feet) by the year 2100.",wikipedia defin climat follow climat encompass statist temperatur humid atmospher pressur wind rainfal atmospher particl count meteorolog element given region long period time climat contrast weather present condit element variat shorter time period climat may inher variabl evidenc irregular season one year anoth variabl normal may remain partial understood relat chang ocean current volcan erupt solar radiat compon climat system addit climat also extrem flood drought hail tornado hurrican devast howev recent decad number indic studi show evid climat warm across globe disturb phenomenon challeng human habit activ respons greenhous ga emiss greenhous effect process absorpt emiss infrar radiat gase atmospher warm planet lower atmospher surfac propos joseph fourier first investig quantit svant arrheniu natur occur greenhous gase mean warm effect human activ sinc industri revolut increas amount greenhous gase atmospher lead increas radi forc methan tropospher ozon cfc chlorofluorocarbon nitrou oxid concentr methan increas respect sinc level much higher time last year period reliabl data extract ice core last three decad centuri gdp gross domest product per caput popul growth main driver increas greenhous ga emiss emiss continu rise due burn fossil fuel chang two major effect global warm increas temperatur earth c fahrenheit year rise sea level least meter foot year,C1
151,Summary othello shakespeare,"Othello (The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice) is a tragedy by William Shakespeare, probably written in 1603.
The story revolves around two characters, Othello and Iago. Othello is a Moorish general in the Venetian army leading his army into a war with the Ottoman Turks over the island of Cyprus. Iago, however, is angry because Othello has promoted Cassio to be his lieutenant instead of him. Othello has secretly married Desdemona, a pretty and rich white Venetian, much younger than he is, against the wishes of her father. Iago maliciously provokes his master's jealousy until the normally stoic North African murders his beloved wife in a fit of temper and kills himself.
In Othello, Shakespeare explores themes such as jealousy, racism, and reality versus appearance.
Jealousy motivates the main characters of the play. Iago is depicted as a jealous character from the beginning. In the first scene, he expresses dissatisfaction when Othello promotes Cassio instead of him. His strong aversion has also its origin in suspecting Othello having an affair with Emilia his wife. His intense jealousy pushes him to take revenge on Othello although these suspicions are only rumors. By maliciously goading his master's jealousy, Iago makes Othello suffer and experience the torments of jealousy towards Desdemona and her supposed lover.
The play also describes some characters as racist. Othello is referred to as a ""Barbary horse"", a "" thick lips"", or a ""lascivious Moor"". The racist characters use these words to portray Othello as an animal or beast, not as a human. He is, thus, considered an outsider to the white Venetian culture, deserving less respect.
Another theme explored in Othello is reality versus appearance. Iago maliciously uses all his wits to manipulate others and make them believe what he wants. He attempts restlessly to mislead other characters, particularly Roderigo and Othello, by encouraging them to misinterpret what they see. His intention to use Othello's honesty as a tool to deceive him serves as a warning for the audience to be cautious about appearance. Reality is not what one sees.",othello tragedi othello moor venic tragedi william shakespear probabl written stori revolv around two charact othello iago othello moorish gener venetian armi lead armi war ottoman turk island cypru iago howev angri othello promot cassio lieuten instead othello secretli marri desdemona pretti rich white venetian much younger wish father iago malici provok master jealousi normal stoic north african murder belov wife fit temper kill othello shakespear explor theme jealousi racism realiti versu appear jealousi motiv main charact play iago depict jealou charact begin first scene express dissatisfact othello promot cassio instead strong avers also origin suspect othello affair emilia wife intens jealousi push take reveng othello although suspicion rumor malici goad master jealousi iago make othello suffer experi torment jealousi toward desdemona suppos lover play also describ charact racist othello refer barbari hors thick lip lascivi moor racist charact use word portray othello anim beast human thu consid outsid white venetian cultur deserv le respect anoth theme explor othello realiti versu appear iago malici use wit manipul other make believ want attempt restlessli mislead charact particularli roderigo othello encourag misinterpret see intent use othello honesti tool deceiv serv warn audienc cautiou appear realiti one see,B2
152,Scarlet letter nathaniel hawthorne,"""The Scarlet Letter: A Romance"" is a novel by American author Nathaniel Hawthorne. It was published in 1850 and is set in Puritan Massachusetts Bay Colony during the years 1642 to 1649.
The novel tells the story of Hester Prynne who conceives a daughter through an affair with a minister of a church, Arthur Dimmesdale. Her daughter Pearl was born more than nine months after Hester left her husband in England to come to America. Because of that, she was forced to wear the scarlet A for ""adulterer."" She then struggles to create a new life of repentance and dignity.
The major theme of ""The Scarlet Letter"" is social stigmatizing. Hawthorne's depiction of Hester's public humiliation and Dimmesdale's private shame and fear of exposure reverse the Puritan's ethics upside down. While the community sees Hester as an immoral woman, her lover as a saint, and would have considered the husband as a betrayed victim, Hawthorne depicts Hester as a sensitive woman with a heart and emotions, her lover as a minister who is far from being a saint and who morally weak and unable to confess his hidden sin and Chillingworth as an evil husband.
""The Scarlet Letter"" was one of the first mass-produced books in America. It was popular when first published and is considered a classic work today. It inspired numerous film, television, and stage adaptations. Critics have described it as a masterwork and novelist D. H. Lawrence called it a ""perfect work of the American imagination"".",scarlet letter romanc novel american author nathaniel hawthorn publish set puritan massachusett bay coloni year novel tell stori hester prynn conceiv daughter affair minist church arthur dimmesdal daughter pearl born nine month hester left husband england come america forc wear scarlet adulter struggl creat new life repent digniti major theme scarlet letter social stigmat hawthorn depict hester public humili dimmesdal privat shame fear exposur revers puritan ethic upsid commun see hester immor woman lover saint would consid husband betray victim hawthorn depict hester sensit woman heart emot lover minist far saint moral weak unabl confess hidden sin chillingworth evil husband scarlet letter one first book america popular first publish consid classic work today inspir numer film televis stage adapt critic describ masterwork novelist lawrenc call perfect work american imagin,B2
153,Culture shock,"Culture shock refers to the feeling of disorientation experienced by people when they move to an unfamiliar cultural environment or when they are suddenly exposed to a different way of life or set of attitudes. This can be the result of immigration or a visit to a new country, a move between social environments, or simply a transition to another type of life.
Culture shock consists of four distinct stages: honeymoon, negotiation, adjustment, and adaptation. The honeymoon stage occurs when the individual sees the differences between the old and new culture in a romantic light. In the negotiation stage, the differences between the old and new culture become apparent and may create anxiety. The adjustment stage refers to the period when the individual grows accustomed to the new culture and develops routines. Finally, in the adaptation stage, individuals are able to participate fully and comfortably in the host culture. Adaptation or acceptance does not mean total conversion; people often keep many traits from their earlier culture, such as accents and languages. It is often referred to as the bicultural stage.
Culture shock may cause homesickness. This refers to the feeling of longing for one's home. People suffering from culture shock typically experience a combination of depressive and anxious symptoms related to homesickness. Ways of coping with homesickness include developing a hobby, thinking positively and feeling grateful about what one has, and building new relationships.
Cultural shock is a natural phenomenon that occurs when one has a cross-cultural experience. Going through the different stages can take weeks, months or years. But ultimately, the experience can be enriching and may end up with either adaptation with the new culture or a return home.",cultur shock refer feel disorient experienc peopl move unfamiliar cultur environ suddenli expo differ way life set attitud result immigr visit new countri move social environ simpli transit anoth type life cultur shock consist four distinct stage honeymoon negoti adjust adapt honeymoon stage occur individu see differ old new cultur romant light negoti stage differ old new cultur becom appar may creat anxieti adjust stage refer period individu grow accustom new cultur develop routin final adapt stage individu abl particip fulli comfort host cultur adapt accept mean total convers peopl often keep mani trait earlier cultur accent languag often refer bicultur stage cultur shock may caus homesick refer feel long one home peopl suffer cultur shock typic experi combin depress anxiou symptom relat homesick way cope homesick includ develop hobbi think posit feel grate one build new relationship cultur shock natur phenomenon occur one experi go differ stage take week month year ultim experi enrich may end either adapt new cultur return home,C1

155,Health,"Health is the general condition of a person's mind, body, and spirit, usually meaning to be free from illness, injury, or pain. The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in 1946 as ""a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.""
Generally, the context in which an individual lives is of great importance on health status and quality of life. It is increasingly recognized that health is maintained and improved not only through the advancement and application of health science, but also through the efforts and intelligent lifestyle choices of the individual and society. According to the World Health Organization, the main determinants of health include the social and economic environment, the physical environment, and the person's individual characteristics and behaviors. In fact, an increasing number of studies and reports from different organizations and contexts examine the linkages between health and different factors, including lifestyles, environments, health care organization, and health policy.
Focusing more on lifestyle issues and their relationships with functional health, data from different studies suggested that people can improve their health via:
In addition to that, the ability to adapt and to self manage have been suggested as core components of human health.
Personal health also depends partially on the social structure of a person's life. The maintenance of strong social relationships, volunteering, and other social activities have been linked to positive mental health and even increased longevity. In contrast, prolonged psychological stress may negatively impact health, and has been cited as a factor in cognitive impairment with aging, depressive illness, and expression of disease.",health gener condit person mind bodi spirit usual mean free ill injuri pain world health organ defin health broader sen state complet physic mental social mere absenc diseas infirm gener context individu live great import health statu qualiti life increasingli recogn health maintain improv advanc applic health scienc also effort intellig lifestyl choic individu societi accord world health organ main determin health includ social econom environ physic environ person individu characterist behavior fact increas number studi report differ organ context examin linkag health differ factor includ lifestyl environ health care organ health polici focus lifestyl issu relationship function health data differ studi suggest peopl improv health via addit abil adapt self manag suggest core compon human health person health also depend partial social structur person life mainten strong social relationship volunt social activ link posit mental health even increas longev contrast prolong psycholog stress may neg impact health cite factor cognit impair age depress ill express diseas,C1
156,Computers,"A computer is a programmable machine designed to automatically carry out a sequence of arithmetic or logical operations. The first use of the word ""computer"" was recorded in 1613, referring to a person who carried out calculations, or computations, and the word continued with the same meaning until the middle of the 20th century. From the end of the 19th century the word began to take on its more familiar meaning, a machine that carries out computations
In the beginning, computers were as big as a large room. It is only later that they have become smaller and smaller, accessible to anyone. This has given way to personal computers. Later developers created new applications to help users perform many things from word processing to image editing. A large scale of programs, some free and others costly, have opened new horizons in information technology.
Now computers have noticeable impact on social relations. They have enabled entirely new forms of social interaction, activities, and organizing. With the Internet, working with computers has become part of our daily lives thanks to its basic features such as widespread usability and access.

157,Internet,"The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet protocol suite, a set of communications protocols, to serve billions of users worldwide. The internet has reshaped and redefined most traditional communications media including telephone, music, film, and television. This has given birth to new services. Newspaper, book and other print publishing are adapting to Web site technology, or are reshaped into blogging and web feeds.
The Internet has enabled or accelerated new forms of human interactions through instant messaging, Internet forums, and social networking. Online shopping has boomed both for major retail outlets and small artisans and traders. Business-to-business and financial services on the Internet affect supply chains across entire industries.
The origins of the Internet reach back to research of the 1960s, commissioned by the United States government in collaboration with private commercial interests to build robust, fault-tolerant, and distributed computer networks. The commercialization of what was by the 1990s an international network resulted in its popularization and incorporation into virtually every aspect of modern human life.

During Spring an important celebration takes place: Easter Day. It varies between March 22 and April 25 in Western tradition, and between April 4 and May 8 in Eastern Christianity.
Spring is a time when flowers bloom and trees begin to grow and reproduce. The days grow longer and the temperature in most areas become more temperate. You can also contemplate the melting of ice and thawing of the ground. The weather during this period becomes much sunnier while hibernating animals begin to come out of hibernation.

159,What is cancel culture,"Develop your reading skills. Read the following text about cancel culture and do the comprehension questions
Cancel culture, also known as call-out culture, refers to the popular practice in which someone is thrust out of social or professional circles - either online on social media, in the real world, or both. It is a modern form of ostracism.
Ostracism was a procedure under Athenian democracy in which any citizen could be expelled from the city-state of Athens for ten years. While some instances clearly expressed popular anger at the citizen, ostracism was often used preemptively. It was used as a way of neutralizing someone thought to be a threat to the state or potential tyrant. The word ""ostracism"" continues to be used for various cases of social shunning.
'Cancel culture' is a modern form of ostracism. Those who are subject to cancel culture are said to be ""canceled."" Merriam-Webster notes that to cancel, as used in this context, means ""to stop giving support to that person"" while Dictionary.com, in its pop-culture dictionary, defines cancel culture as ""withdrawing support for (canceling) public figures and companies after they have done or said something considered objectionable or offensive."" Urban Dictionary describes this modern phenomenon as a practice where a person is ejected from influence or fame by questionable actions. Put differently, cancel culture constitutes a form of boycott involving an individual (usually a celebrity) who is deemed to have acted or spoken in a questionable or controversial manner. For those at the receiving end of call-out culture, the consequence can lead to loss of reputation and income that can be hard to recover from.
Cancel culture is most effective against people who are still growing their reputation in their domains. The aim of cancellation is to set rules for the majority, not demolish those who have already established their place among the stars. According to New York Times, ""a climate of cancellation can succeed in changing the way people talk and argue and behave even if it doesn’t succeed in destroying the careers of some of the famous people that it targets.""
The expression ""cancel culture"" has mostly negative connotations and is commonly used in debates on free speech and censorship. Former US President Barack Obama warned against social media call-out culture saying ""People who do really good stuff have flaws. People who you are fighting may love their kids and, you know, share certain things with you."" Former US President Donald Trump criticized cancel culture in a speech in July 2020, comparing it to totalitarianism and claiming that it is a political weapon used to punish and shame dissenters by driving them from their jobs and demanding submission.",develop read skill read follow text cancel cultur comprehens question cancel cultur also known cultur refer popular practic someon thrust social profession circl either onlin social medium real world modern form ostrac ostrac procedur athenian democraci citizen could expel athen ten year instanc clearli express popular anger citizen ostrac often use preemptiv use way neutral someon thought threat state potenti tyrant word ostrac continu use variou case social shun cultur modern form ostrac subject cancel cultur said cancel note cancel use context mean stop give support person dictionari defin cancel cultur withdraw support cancel public figur compani done said someth consid objection offens urban dictionari describ modern phenomenon practic person eject influenc fame question action put differ cancel cultur constitut form boycott involv individu usual celebr deem act spoken question controversi manner receiv end cultur consequ lead loss reput incom hard recov cancel cultur effect peopl still grow reput domain aim cancel set rule major demolish alreadi establish place among star accord new york time climat cancel succeed chang way peopl talk argu behav even succeed destroy career famou peopl target express cancel cultur mostli neg connot commonli use debat free speech censorship former u presid barack obama warn social medium cultur say peopl realli good stuff flaw peopl fight may love kid know share certain thing former u presid donald trump critic cancel cultur speech juli compar totalitarian claim polit weapon use punish shame dissent drive job demand submiss,C1
160,Malcolm x,"Malcolm X has been called one of the greatest and most influential African Americans in history. His original name was Malcolm Little but was also known as El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz. Malcolm was an African American Muslim minister and human rights activist. He was a courageous advocate for the rights of African Americans, a man who indicted white America in the harshest terms for its crimes against black Americans. Some criticized him of preaching racism, black supremacy, antisemitism, and violence. He .
Malcolm X had a very harsh childhood. His father died when he was young. It was rumored that he was killed by white. Also at least one of his uncles was lynched. When he was thirteen, his mother was placed in a mental hospital, and he was placed in a series of foster homes. In 1946, at age 20, he went to prison for breaking and entering.
While in prison, Malcolm X had undergone so many changes in his personality. He became a member of the Nation of Islam and after his parole in 1952 he quickly rose to become one of its leaders. For a dozen years Malcolm X was the public face of the controversial group, but disillusionment with Nation of Islam head Elijah Muhammad led him to leave the Nation in March 1964. After a period of travel in Africa and the Middle East he returned to the United States, where he founded Muslim Mosque, Inc. and the Organization of Afro-American Unity. In February 1965, less than a year after leaving the Nation of Islam, he was assassinated by three members of the group.
Malcolm X's expressed beliefs changed substantially over time. As a spokesman for the Nation of Islam he taught black supremacy and advocated separation of black and white Americans—a stark contrast with the civil rights movement's emphasis on integration. After breaking with the Nation of Islam in 1964—saying of his association with it, ""I was a zombie then ... pointed in a certain direction and told to march""—and becoming a Sunni Muslim, he disavowed racism and expressed willingness to work with civil rights leaders, though still emphasizing black self-determination and self defense.",malcolm x call one greatest influenti african american histori origin name malcolm littl also known malik malcolm african american muslim minist human right activist courag advoc right african american man indict white america harshest term crime black american critic preach racism black supremaci antisemit violenc malcolm x harsh childhood father die young rumor kill white also least one uncl lynch thirteen mother place mental hospit place seri foster home age went prison break enter prison malcolm x undergon mani chang person becam member nation islam parol quickli rose becom one leader dozen year malcolm x public face controversi group disillusion nation islam head elijah muhammad led leav nation march period travel africa middl east return unit state found muslim mosqu organ uniti februari le year leav nation islam assassin three member group malcolm x express belief chang substanti time spokesman nation islam taught black supremaci advoc separ black white stark contrast civil right movement emphasi integr break nation islam associ zombi point certain direct told march becom sunni muslim disavow racism express willing work civil right leader though still emphas black self defens,B2

162,George orwell biography,"George Orwell, whose real name is Eric Arthur Blair, was an English novelist, essayist, journalist and critic. His work is marked by lucid prose, awareness of social injustice, opposition to totalitarianism, and commitment to democratic socialism.
Orwell was born on the 25th June, 1903 in Motihari, Bihar, in British India where he spent his first days. His mother brought him and his older sister, Marjorie, to England about a year after his birth and settled in Henley-on-Thames. Because his father stayed behind in India and rarely visited, George Orwell and his father never formed a strong bond.
Orwell was later sent to a boarding school, which he hated and where he got his first taste of England's class system. On a partial scholarship, Orwell noticed that the school treated the richer students better than the poorer ones. He won scholarships to Wellington College and Eton College to continue his studies. Because his family couldn't pay for his university education,Orwell joined the Indian Imperial Police in Burma, then a British colony. He resigned in 1927 and decided to become a writer.
Orwell is well-known for his literary criticism, poetry, fiction, and polemical journalism. He has gained world wide acknowledgement for his dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) and the allegorical novella Animal Farm (1945). His book Homage to Catalonia (1938), an account of his experiences in the Spanish Civil War, is widely acclaimed, as are his numerous essays on politics, literature, language, and culture. In 2008, The Times ranked him second on a list of ""The 50 greatest British writers since 1945""
Orwell's work has had a great impact on popular and political culture. The term Orwellian is an example of this influence. This term describes totalitarian or authoritarian social practices. It has entered the English language together with many other of his neologisms, including cold war, Big Brother, thought police, Room 101, doublethink, and thoughtcrime.
Orwell was diagnosed as having tuberculosis in December 1947.

163,International women day,"International Women's Day (IWD) is marked on March 8 every year. Countries around the world celebrate IWD to give credit to the economic, political and social achievements of women and to show respect to their contributions in the development of their countries. The IWD was first celebrated on 19 March 1911 in Germany following a declaration by the Socialist Party of America. It's only in the beginning of the 20th century that the day was officially and internationally acknowledged due to the rapid industrialization and the social protest that it accompanied.
On this day women are usually given flowers and small gifts. It is also celebrated as an equivalent of Mother's Day in some countries. Children also give small gifts to their mothers and grandmothers. In countries like Portugal, it is customary, at the night of 8 March, for groups of women to celebrate the holiday with women-only dinners and parties. In 1975, the United Nations gave official sanction to and started financing International Women's Day.
Although, women are becoming more powerful in business, entertainment, politics and many more areas, there are still a lot of inequalities around the world which call for the mobilization of everybody to grant women the proper status they merit.",intern woman day iwd mark march everi year countri around world celebr iwd give credit econom polit social achiev woman show respect contribut develop countri iwd first celebr march germani follow declar socialist parti america begin centuri day offici intern acknowledg due rapid industri social protest accompani day woman usual given flower small gift also celebr equival mother day countri child also give small gift mother grandmoth countri like portug customari night march group woman celebr holiday dinner parti unit nation gave offici sanction start financ intern woman day although woman becom power busi entertain polit mani area still lot inequ around world call mobil everybodi grant woman proper statu merit,C1
164,Technology,"The term technology comes from the combination of these two Greek morphemes tékhnē, (meaning “art”) and ‎-logía (meaning “study”). It refers to the collection of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation.
The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Agricultural Revolution increased the available sources of food. Likewise, the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Later developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. The steady progress of military technology has brought weapons of ever-increasing destructive power.
Technology has been a subject of discussion in philosophy since the Greeks. The Greek philosopher Democritus, for example, believed that technology is an imitation of nature. House-building and weaving were first invented by imitating swallows and spiders building their nests and nets, respectively.
Aristotle held the same view that technology is the consequence of imitation of nature, but he added in his book Physics Book II that:
""generally art in some cases completes what nature cannot bring to a finish.""
Aristotle also distinguishes between natural things and artifacts. According to Aristotle, the former have their principles of generation and motion inside, whereas the latter, insofar as they are artifacts, are generated only by outward causes. For example, animals, which are natural things, can grow, move, and reproduce. A wooden bed, which is an artifact made by a human, cannot move, grow, or reproduce itself.
Today, technology is a subject of debate because it is considered to be a double-edged sword. While it has helped humanity in extending its potential with outstanding inventions, it is nonetheless threatening humankind through some other destructive ones. In addition to polluting the earth in unprecedented ways, wars have become more and more devastating due to technological inventions. Ethical dimensions of recent technological developments, such as DNA engineering, have become a focal point of questioning and discussion. Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it.
To make matters worse, a consensus definition of technology has become more difficult to find due to recent evolution in science and its applications. It is especially confusing to decide whether technology refers to the machines (or more precisely the hardware), the rules that govern or make them work, the system that operates them or the different applications of science that are related to them. What is sure is that technology has shaped societies and adapted itself to people's changing needs.
Until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but 21st-century scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and passed their knowledge to other generations.",term technolog come combin two greek morphem tékhnē mean art mean studi refer collect techniqu skill method process use product good servic accomplish object scientif investig human speci use technolog began convers natur resourc simpl tool prehistor discoveri control fire later agricultur revolut increas avail sourc food likewis invent wheel help human travel control environ later develop histor time includ print press telephon internet lessen physic barrier commun allow human interact freeli global scale steadi progress militari technolog brought weapon destruct power technolog subject discus philosophi sinc greek greek philosoph democritu exampl believ technolog imit natur weav first invent imit swallow spider build nest net respect aristotl held view technolog consequ imit natur ad book physic book ii gener art case complet natur bring finish aristotl also distinguish natur thing artifact accord aristotl former principl gener motion insid wherea latter insofar artifact gener outward caus exampl anim natur thing grow move reproduc wooden bed artifact made human move grow reproduc today technolog subject debat consid sword help human extend potenti outstand invent nonetheless threaten humankind destruct one addit pollut earth unpreced way war becom devast due technolog invent ethic dimens recent technolog develop dna engin becom focal point question discus philosoph debat arisen use technolog disagr whether technolog improv human condit worsen make matter wors consensu definit technolog becom difficult find due recent evolut scienc applic especi confus decid whether technolog refer machin precis hardwar rule govern make work system oper differ applic scienc relat sure technolog shape societi adapt peopl chang need recent believ develop technolog restrict human be scientif studi indic primat certain dolphin commun develop simpl tool pas knowledg gener,C2
165,Cellist of sarajevo,"During the terrible civil war in Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, Sarajevo was besieged and the population was continually under attack. There were many civilian victims. To make matters worse, people had to live without water, electricity or food. Few shops were open.
On May 27, 1992, a bakery opened in the afternoon and many people queued to buy bread. Unfortunately, a mortar shell exploded near the shop and twenty-two people were killed while waiting for their turn to buy fresh bread.
Vedran Smailovic lived near the shop. When he heard the news, he was so sad that he decided to do something about it. He was a musician and he didn't find a better answer to this tragedy than playing his cello, most notably performing Albinoni's Adagio in G Minor, one of the saddest pieces of music. For twenty-two days, he put on his concert clothes, took his plastic chair to the ruined square of the downtown Sarajevo marketplace, and started playing music at exactly four o'clock in the afternoon. He was often under the threat of snipers and shells, but fortunately, he was never hurt. His bravery inspired musical numbers and a novel. For example, in his honor, composer David Wilde wrote a piece for solo cello, The Cellist of Sarajevo, which was recorded by Yo Yo Ma. Canadian author Elizabeth Wellburn also worked with Smailovic to create the children's book Echoes from the Square (1998). Another Canadian author, Steven Galloway, based a character on Smailovic in his bestselling 2008 novel, The Cellist of Sarajevo.
Vedran Smailovic escaped the city in late 1993 and has since been involved in numerous music projects as a performer, composer, and conductor. He now lives in Warrenpoint, Northern Ireland.",terribl civil war yugoslavia earli sarajevo besieg popul continu attack mani civilian victim make matter wors peopl live without water electr food shop open may bakeri open afternoon mani peopl queu buy bread unfortun mortar shell explod near shop peopl kill wait turn buy fresh bread vedran smailov live near shop heard news sad decid someth musician find better answer tragedi play cello notabl perform albinoni adagio g minor one saddest piec music day put concert cloth took plastic chair ruin squar downtown sarajevo marketplac start play music exactli four afternoon often threat sniper shell fortun never hurt braveri inspir music number novel exampl honor compos david wild wrote piec solo cello cellist sarajevo record yo yo canadian author elizabeth wellburn also work smailov creat child book echo squar anoth canadian author steven galloway base charact smailov bestsel novel cellist sarajevo vedran smailov escap citi late sinc involv numer music project perform compos conductor live warrenpoint northern ireland,B2

167,Organizations league of nations,"The League of Nations was the first international organisation whose principal mission was to maintain world peace. This intergovernmental organisation was founded on 10 January 1920 as a result of the Paris Peace Conference that ended World War 1. Its principal goals included preventing wars through collective security and disarmament and settling international disputes through negotiation and arbitration. Other issues in this and related treaties included labour conditions, just treatment of native inhabitants, human and drug trafficking, the arms trade, global health, prisoners of war, and protection of minorities in Europe.
Although the diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift from the preceding hundred years, it had its pitfalls. The League lacked its own armed force and depended on the Great Powers to enforce its resolutions, keep to its economic sanctions, or provide an army when needed. However, the Great Powers were often reluctant to do so. Sanctions could hurt League members, so they were reluctant to comply with them. During the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, when the League accused Italian soldiers of targeting Red Cross medical tents, Benito Mussolini responded that ""the League is very well when sparrows shout, but no good at all when eagles fall out.""
After a number of notable successes and some early failures in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the Axis powers which included Germany, Italy, and Japan in the 1930s. Germany withdrew from the League, as did Japan, Italy, Spain, and others. The onset of the Second World War showed that the League had failed its primary purpose, which was to prevent any future world war. The League lasted for 26 years; the United Nations (UN) replaced it after the end of the Second World War on 20 April 1946 and inherited a number of agencies and organisations founded by the League.",leagu nation first intern organis whose princip mission maintain world peac intergovernment organis found januari result pari peac confer end world war princip goal includ prevent war collect secur disarma settl intern disput negoti arbitr issu relat treati includ labour condit treatment nativ inhabit human drug traffick arm trade global health prison war protect minor europ although diplomat philosophi behind leagu repres fundament shift preced hundr year pitfal leagu lack arm forc depend great power enforc resolut keep econom sanction provid armi need howev great power often reluct sanction could hurt leagu member reluct compli second war leagu accus italian soldier target red cross medic tent benito mussolini respond leagu well sparrow shout good eagl fall number notabl success earli failur leagu ultim prove incap prevent aggress axi power includ germani itali japan germani withdrew leagu japan itali spain other onset second world war show leagu fail primari purpos prevent futur world war leagu last year unit nation un replac end second world war april inherit number agenc organis found leagu,C1
168,What is meditation,"Meditation refers to a practice where a person uses techniques, such as mindfulness, or focusing their mind on a particular object, thought, or activity. Meditation aims at training the attention and awareness and achieving a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state.
Meditation has been practiced since antiquity in numerous religious traditions and beliefs, often as part of the path towards enlightenment and self-realization. Since the 19th century, it has spread from its origins to other cultures where it is commonly practiced in private and business life.
Most meditation techniques don't require specialized equipment or space. 


While meditating, the individual has to be aware of the body's reactions to every inhalation and exhalation. That is, as one breathes attention should be brought to the movement of your body mainly the chest, the belly, and the shoulders.

Meditation is an old practice that aims at training the mind and the body to relax and get calm. It is known for improving psychological balance, dealing with illness, and enhancing general health and well-being. Some of the benefits of meditation identified by experts include:",medit refer practic person use techniqu mind focus mind particular object thought activ medit aim train attent awar achiev mental clear emot calm stabl state medit practic sinc antiqu numer religi tradit belief often part path toward enlighten sinc centuri spread origin cultur commonli practic privat busi life medit techniqu requir special equip space medit individu awar bodi reaction everi inhal exhal one breath attent brought movement bodi mainli chest belli shoulder medit old practic aim train mind bodi relax get calm known improv psycholog balanc deal ill enhanc gener health benefit medit identifi expert includ,C1
169,Political parties presidential election us,"There have usually only been two main political parties in the US. Since the 1860s, two main parties have been the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. It should be noted though that there are other minor parties such as the Libertarian Party, the Green Party, and Constitution Party.
The Democratic Party started in 1828 as a pro-slavery party with its Andrew Jackson as the first President in 1829. However, through the economic resurgence after the Great Depression in the 1930s and 1940s, as well as the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, the Democratic party became an advocate of racial equality. The party's philosophy of modern liberalism adopts social and economic equality principles. It aims at setting government intervention and regulation in the economy such as the introduction of social programs, support for labor unions, affordable college tuitions, universal health care, equal opportunity, consumer protection, and environmental protection.
The Republican party, however, started as an anti-slavery party in 1854. Its first President was Abraham Lincoln in 1861. In the Nixon years, there was a shift to appeal to the implicit racial biases of white voters that did not like the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The philosophy of the party focuses on social and economic independence, and a capitalist economic system. It is also known for its anti-abortion efforts, anti-regulatory policy, and reduction of government intervention in the economy as well as being in support of privatized health care.
The election of the president and the vice president of the United States is an indirect election in which citizens of the United States who are registered to vote in one of the fifty U.S. states or Washington, D.C., cast ballots not directly for those offices, but instead for members of the Electoral College - a group of presidential electors. These electors then cast direct votes, known as electoral votes, for president and vice president. The candidate who receives an absolute majority of electoral votes (at least 270 out of 538, since the Twenty-Third Amendment granted voting rights to citizens of D.C.) is then elected to that office. If no candidate receives an absolute majority of the votes for president, the House of Representatives chooses the most qualifying candidate for the presidency; if no one receives an absolute majority of the votes for vice president, then the Senate elects the vice president.",usual two main polit parti u sinc two main parti republican parti democrat parti note though minor parti libertarian parti green parti constitut parti democrat parti start parti andrew jackson first presid howev econom resurg great depress well civil right movement democrat parti becam advoc racial equal parti philosophi modern liber adopt social econom equal principl aim set govern intervent regul economi introduct social program support labor union afford colleg tuition univers health care equal opportun consum protect environment protect republican parti howev start parti first presid abraham lincoln nixon year shift appeal implicit racial bias white voter like civil right movement philosophi parti focus social econom independ capitalist econom system also known effort polici reduct govern intervent economi well support privat health care elect presid vice presid unit state indirect elect citizen unit state regist vote one fifti state washington cast ballot directli offic instead member elector colleg group presidenti elector elector cast direct vote known elector vote presid vice presid candid receiv absolut major elector vote least sinc amend grant vote right citizen elect offic candid receiv absolut major vote presid hous repres choos qualifi candid presid one receiv absolut major vote vice presid senat elect vice presid,C1
170,Greta thunberg,"Develop your reading skills. Read the following text about Greta Thunberg and do the comprehension questions
Greta Thunberg, born on 3rd January 2003, is a Swedish environmental activist on climate change whose campaigning has gained international recognition. Together with many students around the world, Greta launched a school climate strike movement known as ""Fridays for Future"". After Thunberg addressed the 2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference, she inspired students worldwide to adhere to her movement.  In 2019, there were at least two coordinated multi-city protests involving over one million students each. At home, Thunberg convinced her parents to adopt several lifestyle choices to reduce their carbon footprint, including giving up air travel and not eating meat.
Her sudden rise to world fame has made her a leader and a target. President Jair Bolsonaro called her a ""brat"" after she expressed concern about the killing of indigenous Brazilians in the Amazon. Greta reacted by slightly changing her Twitter bio to ""Pirralha"", which means ‘brat’ in Portuguese. Vladimir Putin criticized her as ""poorly informed"" while Donald rump mocked her by tweeting:
""She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!""
In May 2019, Thunberg was featured on the cover of Time magazine, which named her a ""next-generation leader"" and noted that many see her as a role model. The magazine chose her as the person of the year and quoted her saying in front of television cameras:
""People are underestimating the force of angry kids… We are angry and frustrated, and that is because of good reason. If they want us to stop being angry then maybe they should stop making us angry.""
Greta has been the recipient of several honors and awards. In addition to being chosen as the youngest person to be chosen by Time magazine in a tradition that started in 1927 and named her one of the 100 most influential people, she was also nominated as a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize. She has received other honors and awards such as fellowship of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. The school strike movement was also featured in a 30-minute Vice documentary titled Make the World Greta Again. Some media have described her impact on the world stage as the ""Greta Thunberg effect"".",develop read skill read follow text greta thunberg comprehens question greta thunberg born januari swedish environment activist climat chang whose campaign gain intern recognit togeth mani student around world greta launch school climat strike movement known friday futur thunberg address unit nation climat chang confer inspir student worldwid adher movement least two coordin protest involv one million student home thunberg convinc parent adopt sever lifestyl choic reduc carbon footprint includ give air travel eat meat sudden rise world fame made leader target presid jair bolsonaro call brat express concern kill indigen brazilian amazon greta react slightli chang twitter bio pirralha mean brat portugues vladimir putin critic poorli inform donald rump mock tweet seem like happi young girl look forward bright wonder futur nice see may thunberg featur cover time magazin name leader note mani see role model magazin chose person year quot say front televis camera peopl underestim forc angri angri frustrat good reason want u stop angri mayb stop make u angri greta recipi sever honor award addit chosen youngest person chosen time magazin tradit start name one influenti peopl also nomin candid nobel peac prize receiv honor award fellowship royal scottish geograph societi school strike movement also featur vice documentari titl make world greta medium describ impact world stage greta thunberg effect,C1
171,The green mile film review,"The Green Mile is a 1999 American fantasy crime drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King’s 1996 novel of the same name. It stars Tom Hanks as a death row corrections officer and Michael Clarke Duncan as an enigmatic inmate. David Morse, Bonnie Hunt, Doug Hutchison and James Cromwell appear in supporting roles.
Although much of the three-hour movie takes place in the prison during the U.S. Great Depression, there is an intelligent use of exterior locations and flashbacks. The story starts with Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) walking the green mile - the greenish pathway from cellular to the execution room- with a variety of convicts. He gets acquainted with John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a huge black man condemned for cruelly killing two young sisters. Throughout the movie, one can feel that Coffey had the physical strength to kill anyone, but deep inside his heart, he embodies kindness itself. Coffey is depicted as having a simple, naive nature and a fear of the dark, but seems to have an extraordinary, supernatural ability. At a certain time in the story, Paul starts doubting whether Coffey is actually guilty of killing the two young innocent girls.
The Green Mile is one of the best movies ever made, and for good reasons.  To start with, the acting and direction are just amazing. In addition, the story is thought provoking, depicting the eternal battle between good and evil. The story contrasts generous, altruistic characters with others who represent humanity’s cruelty. With that being said, the movie’s downside is the horrific torture scene near the end. It might be very disturbing and scary for kids.",green mile american fantasi crime drama film written direct frank darabont base stephen king novel name star tom hank death row correct offic michael clark duncan enigmat inmat david mors bonni hunt doug hutchison jame cromwel appear support role although much movi take place prison great depress intellig use exterior locat flashback stori start paul edgecomb tom hank walk green mile greenish pathway cellular execut varieti convict get acquaint john coffey michael clark duncan huge black man condemn cruelli kill two young sister throughout movi one feel coffey physic strength kill anyon deep insid heart embodi kind coffey depict simpl naiv natur fear dark seem extraordinari supernatur abil certain time stori paul start doubt whether coffey actual guilti kill two young innoc girl green mile one best movi ever made good reason start act direct amaz addit stori thought provok depict etern battl good evil stori contrast gener altruist charact other repres human cruelti said movi downsid horrif tortur scene near end might disturb scari kid,B2
172,Herman melville short biography,"Herman Melville was an American author known for his novel Moby Dick. This a short biography that presents interesting facts about his life and his works.
Herman Melville was an American novelist, short story writer, and poet of the American Renaissance period. He was born on August 1, 1819, in New York City and died on September 28, 1891. He is best known for his works Typee (1846), a romantic account of his experiences of Polynesian life, and his whaling novel Moby-Dick (1851).
Melville's education began when he was five, around the time the family moved to a newly built house at 33 Bleecker Street in Manhattan. In 1826, the same year that Melville contracted scarlet fever, Herman's father, Allan Melville, who sent his sons, Gansevoort and Herman to the New York Male High School, described Melville as ""very backward in speech & somewhat slow in comprehension"". His older brother Gansevoort appeared to be the brightest of the children, but soon Melville's development increased its pace. Later, his father wrote:
""Herman I think is making more progress than formerly & without being a bright Scholar, he maintains a respectable standing, & would proceed further, if he could only be induced to study more—being a most amiable & innocent child, I cannot find it in my heart to coerce him"".
On May 31, 1839, Herman's brother, Gansevoort, then living in New York City, wrote that he was sure Herman could get a job on a whaler or merchants' vessel. The next day, he signed aboard the merchant ship St. Lawrence as a ""boy"" (a green hand), which cruised from New York to Liverpool; he arrived back in New York October 1. Redburn: His First Voyage (1849) draws on his experiences in this journey.
Heman subsequently signed up for a whaling voyage aboard a new ship, the Acushnet after a short period of teaching. On January 3, 1841, the Acushnet set sail. Whales were found near The Bahamas, and in March 150 barrels of oil were sent home from Rio de Janeiro.
In 1851, Melville published what would become his signature work, Moby-Dick (initially titled The Whale). Moby-Dick is classified as an example of American Romanticism. It is based on both Melville's years of experience aboard whaleships and the real-life disaster of the Essex whaleship.
The Essex whaleship was attacked and sunk by a sperm whale. Stranded thousands of miles from the coast of South America with little food and water, the 20-man crew was forced to make for land in the ship's surviving whaleboats. They suffered severe dehydration, starvation, and exposure on the open ocean, and the survivors eventually resorted to eating the bodies of the crewmen who had died. The tragedy attracted international attention and inspired Herman Melville to write his famous novel Moby-Dick.
In 1867, his oldest child Malcolm died at home from a self-inflicted gunshot. Clarel: A Poem and Pilgrimage in the Holy Land was published in 1876, a metaphysical epic. In 1886, his son Stanwix died, and Melville retired. During his last years, he privately published two volumes of poetry, left one volume unpublished, and returned to the prose of the sea. The novella Billy Budd was left unfinished at his death but was published in 1924. Melville's death from cardiovascular disease in 1891 subdued a reviving interest in his work. The 1919 centennial of his birth became the starting point of the ""Melville Revival"". Critics discovered his work, scholars explored his life; his major novels and stories have come to be considered world classics, and his poetry has gradually gained respect.",herman melvil american author known novel mobi dick short biographi present interest fact life work herman melvil american novelist short stori writer poet american renaiss period born august new york citi die septemb best known work type romant account experi polynesian life whale novel melvil educ began five around time famili move newli built hous bleecker street manhattan year melvil contract scarlet fever herman father allan melvil sent son gansevoort herman new york male high school describ melvil backward speech somewhat slow comprehens older brother gansevoort appear brightest child soon melvil develop increas pace later father wrote herman think make progress formerli without bright scholar maintain respect stand would proceed could induc studi amiabl innoc child find heart coerc may herman brother gansevoort live new york citi wrote sure herman could get job whaler merchant vessel next day sign aboard merchant ship lawrenc boy green hand cruis new york liverpool arriv back new york octob redburn first voyag draw experi journey heman subsequ sign whale voyag aboard new ship acushnet short period teach januari acushnet set sail whale found near bahama march barrel oil sent home rio de janeiro melvil publish would becom signatur work initi titl whale classifi exampl american romantic base melvil year experi aboard whaleship disast essex whaleship essex whaleship attack sunk sperm whale strand thousand mile coast south america littl food water crew forc make land ship surviv whaleboat suffer sever dehydr starvat exposur open ocean survivor eventu resort eat bodi crewman die tragedi attract intern attent inspir herman melvil write famou novel oldest child malcolm die home gunshot clarel poem pilgrimag holi land publish metaphys epic son stanwix die melvil retir last year privat publish two volum poetri left one volum unpublish return prose sea novella billi budd left unfinish death publish melvil death cardiovascular diseas subdu reviv interest work centenni birth becam start point melvil reviv critic discov work scholar explor life major novel stori come consid world classic poetri gradual gain respect,B2
173,Film,"A film, also called a movie or motion picture, is a series of still images on a strip of plastic which, when run through a projector and shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI (Computer-generated imagery) and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry.
Films usually include an optical soundtrack, which is a graphic recording of the spoken words, music and other sounds that are to accompany the images. It runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it and is not projected.
Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures. They reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important art form, a source of popular entertainment, and a powerful medium for educating—or indoctrinating—citizens. The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide attractions by using dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog into the language of the viewer.
The individual images that make up a film are called frames. During projection, a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame in turn is moved into position to be projected, but the viewer does not notice the interruptions because of an effect known as persistence of vision, whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after the source has been removed. The perception of motion is due to a psychological effect called beta movement.
The name ""film"" originates from the fact that photographic film (also called film stock) has historically been the medium for recording and displaying motion pictures. Many other terms exist for an individual motion picture, including picture, picture show, moving picture, photoplay and flick. The most common term in the United States is movie, while in Europe film is preferred. Terms for the field in general include the big screen, the silver screen, the movies and cinema; the latter is commonly used in scholarly texts and critical essays, especially by European writers. In early years, the word sheet was sometimes used instead of screen.",film also call movi motion pictur seri still imag strip plastic run projector shown screen creat illus move imag film creat photograph actual scene motion pictur camera photograph draw miniatur model use tradit anim techniqu mean cgi imageri comput anim combin techniqu visual effect process filmmak art industri film usual includ optic soundtrack graphic record spoken word music sound accompani imag run along portion film exclus reserv project film cultur artifact creat specif cultur reflect cultur turn affect film consid import art form sourc popular entertain power medium visual basi film give univers power commun film becom popular worldwid attract use dub subtitl translat dialog languag viewer individu imag make film call frame project rotat shutter caus interv dark frame turn move posit project viewer notic interrupt effect known persist vision wherebi eye retain visual imag fraction second sourc remov percept motion due psycholog effect call beta movement name film origin fact photograph film also call film stock histor medium record display motion pictur mani term exist individu motion pictur includ pictur pictur show move pictur photoplay flick common term unit state movi europ film prefer term field gener includ big screen silver screen movi cinema latter commonli use scholarli text critic essay especi european writer earli year word sheet sometim use instead screen,C2
174,What is cubism,"Cubism is an artistic movement that emerged during the early 20th century. In Cubist artwork, objects are analyzed, broken up and reassembled in an abstracted form. Instead of depicting objects from a single viewpoint, the artist depicts the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context.
Cubism is credited for paving the way to the 20th-century Modern art movements. In its various forms, this artistic movement also inspired related movements in literature, music, and architecture.
Cubism was pioneered mainly by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. It has been considered to be among the most influential art movements of the 20th century. The term is broadly used in association with a wide variety of art produced in Paris (Montmartre, Montparnasse, and Puteaux) during the 1910s and throughout the 1920s. One primary influence that led to Cubism was the representation of three-dimensional form in the late works of Paul Cézanne.
It is believed that the term Cubism was coined in 1908 by the French art critic Louis Vauxcelles when he described some of Georges Braque's paintings as 'geometric schemas and cubes'.
The impact of Cubism was far-reaching and wide-ranging. Movements such as Futurism, Suprematism, Dada, Constructivism, De Stijl and Art Deco developed in response to Cubism. Early Futurist paintings hold in common with Cubism the fusing of the past and the present, the representation of different views of the subject pictured at the same time, also called multiple perspectives, simultaneity or multiplicity. Constructivism, on the other hand, was influenced by Picasso's technique of constructing sculpture from separate elements. Other common threads between these disparate movements include the faceting or simplification of geometric forms and the association of mechanization and modern life.",cubism artist movement emerg earli centuri cubist artwork object analyz broken reassembl abstract form instead depict object singl viewpoint artist depict subject multitud viewpoint repres subject greater context cubism credit pave way modern art movement variou form artist movement also inspir relat movement literatur music architectur cubism pioneer mainli pablo picasso georg braqu consid among influenti art movement centuri term broadli use associ wide varieti art produc pari montmartr montparnass puteaux throughout one primari influenc led cubism represent form late work paul cézann believ term cubism coin french art critic loui vauxcel describ georg braqu paint schema cube impact cubism movement futur supremat dada constructiv de stijl art deco develop respons cubism earli futurist paint hold common cubism fuse past present represent differ view subject pictur time also call multipl perspect simultan multipl constructiv hand influenc picasso techniqu construct sculptur separ element common thread dispar movement includ facet simplif geometr form associ mechan modern life,C1
175,Civil rights movement,"The Civil Rights Movement in the United States is not new but dates back to the first years of slavery and the events of the Civil War. But major achievements were gained during the second half of the 20th century. Before this period, African-Americans had suffered from inhuman segregation, violence and exploitation.The Civil Rights Movement used nonviolent protests to outlaw racial discrimination against African Americans and restore voting rights to them.
Major campaigns of civil resistance were the main feature of the movement. Crisis situations between activists and government authorities were produced by acts of nonviolent protests and civil disobedience during the period between 1955 and 1968. Federal, state, and local governments, businesses, and communities often had to respond immediately to these situations that highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of protest and/or civil disobedience included boycotts such as the successful Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955–1956) in Alabama; ""sit-ins"" such as the influential Greensboro sit-ins (1960) in North Carolina; marches, such as the Selma to Montgomery marches (1965) in Alabama; and a wide range of other nonviolent activities.
Noted legislative achievements during this phase of the Civil Rights Movement were passage of Civil Rights Act of 1964, that banned discrimination based on ""race, color, religion, or national origin"" in employment practices and public accommodations; the Voting Rights Act of 1965, that restored and protected voting rights; the Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965, that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the Fair Housing Act of 1968, that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.

176,Women,"Women won their present status through struggle and sacrifices rather than through men's kindness. Women and their supporters have fought and in some places continue to fight for the same rights as men. Laws were made to replace local customs which denigrated and suppressed women's rights. Women have gained higher positions in the world at all levels: political, economic and social.
Historically, whether in Hindu, Greek or Roman civilizations women were always minors and subject to men. It was only during the Islamic civilization, between 610 and 661, that the early reforms were undertaken. The reforms gave women greater rights than Muslim women in pre-Islamic Arabia and medieval Europe.These reforms included greater rights in marriage, divorce and inheritance. Women were not accorded with such legal status in other cultures until centuries later.
During the middle ages women were enslaved and were denied all rights in Europe. In the late 18th century, however, women's status became a subject of political debate. In the 19th century women started their fight for equal rights. In the late 19th century they won the right to vote (suffrage) in various countries in the world. More gigantic steps were taken during the following years. Women gained more economic, social and political status in various degrees and in different countries.
In Spite of all the success women still suffer from discrimination at various levels. For example women work more and earn less than men. In addition to that, the majority of the world's poor and illiterate are women. The road to real equality is still long.",woman present statu struggl sacrific rather men kind woman support fought place continu fight right men law made replac local custom denigr suppress woman right woman gain higher posit world level polit econom social histor whether hindu greek roman civil woman alway minor subject men islam civil earli reform undertaken reform gave woman greater right muslim woman arabia mediev reform includ greater right marriag divorc inherit woman accord legal statu cultur centuri later middl age woman enslav deni right europ late centuri howev woman statu becam subject polit debat centuri woman start fight equal right late centuri right vote suffrag variou countri world gigant step taken follow year woman gain econom social polit statu variou degre differ countri spite success woman still suffer discrimin variou level exampl woman work earn le men addit major world poor illiter woman road real equal still long,C1
177,Romeo and juliet,"Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare early in his career about two young star-crossed lovers whose deaths ultimately reconcile their feuding families. It was among Shakespeare's most popular plays during his lifetime and, along with Hamlet, is one of his most frequently performed plays. Today, the characters of Romeo and Juliet are considered as archetypal young lovers.
Romeo and Juliet belongs to a tradition of tragic romances stretching back to antiquity. Its plot is based on an Italian tale, translated into verse as The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke in 1562 and retold in prose in Palace of Pleasure by William Painter in 1567. Shakespeare borrowed heavily from both but, to expand the plot, developed supporting characters, particularly Mercutio and Paris. Believed to have been written between 1591 and 1595, the play was first published in a quarto version in 1597. This text was of poor quality, and later editions corrected it, bringing it more in line with Shakespeare's original.",romeo juliet tragedi written william shakespear earli career two young lover whose death ultim reconcil feud famili among shakespear popular play lifetim along hamlet one frequent perform play today charact romeo juliet consid archetyp young lover romeo juliet belong tradit tragic romanc stretch back antiqu plot base italian tale translat vers tragic histori romeu juliet arthur brook retold prose palac pleasur william painter shakespear borrow heavili expand plot develop support charact particularli mercutio pari believ written play first publish quarto version text poor qualiti later edit correct bring line shakespear origin,B1
178,Columbus day,"Columbus Day is celebrated each year on the second Monday of October. It is considered a Federal holiday in the USA and is also observed in other countries in the Americas. It commemorates the anniversary of Christopher Columbus' arrival in the New World on October 12, 1492.
Christopher Columbus was an Italian explorer who became a subject of the Hispanic Monarchy and led Spanish ships to cross the Atlantic Ocean to discover an alternative route to the Far East, only to arrive in The American Continent.
Columbus' initial journey to the New World on the Spanish ships Santa María, Niña, and La Pinta took around three months. Columbus and his crew's arrival in the American Continent initiated the colonization of the Americas by Spain, followed in the subsequent centuries by other countries from the Old World (i.e., Europe.).
The discovery of the New World resulted in the exchange of goods, animals, culture, people, and technologies from the American Continent to Europe and vice versa. This transfer is an event referred to by some late 20th‐century historians as the Columbian Exchange.
The celebration of Columbus Day differs from state to state. In some areas, large-scale parades and events are organized while in others, complete non-observance is witnessed. Most states that commemorate Columbus Day close state services, while others work normally.
Recently, Native Americans and other organizations have criticized the commemoration of an event that culminated in the colonization of the Americas, the start of the transatlantic slave trade, and the deaths of millions of people due to murder and illness.
More people are now opposing Columbus' and other Europeans' activities against the indigenous peoples of the Americas. Native Americans spearheaded the opposition, which was later supported by left-wing political groups.
Alternative celebrations are observed now in many parts of the Americas. Many states and cities in the United States celebrate Indigenous People's Day. Peru has been commemorating the Day of the Indigenous Peoples and Intercultural Dialogue (""Día de los pueblos originarios y el diálogo intercultural"") since 2009. The day is also known as Pan American Day and Dia de las Américas (""Day of the Americas"") in Belize and Uruguay.

179,Types of occupation,"An occupation (also called a job) is an activity, often regular and often performed in exchange for payment (""for a living""). Many people have multiple jobs. for example, a person can begin a job by becoming an employee, volunteering, starting a business, etc. The duration of a job may range from temporary (e.g., hourly odd jobs) to a lifetime (e.g., judges).
An activity that requires a person's mental or physical effort is work (as in ""a day's work""). If a person is trained for a certain type of job, they may have a profession (e.g. teacher, pilot, judge). Typically, a job would be a subset of someone's career. The latter term is much more general, referring to an individual's metaphorical ""journey"" through learning, work and other aspects of life. One way to differentiate between job and career is the fact that a career ends with retirement while a job ends with resignation.
Many categorizations of jobs are possible.
One categorization of jobs distinguishes between paid jobs (e.g. teacher, pilot) and unpaid jobs(e.g. housework, volunteering, mentoring) or between jobs that require specific training and those that require an academic degree.
Another type of jobs is referred to as moonlighting. It is the practice of holding an additional job or jobs, often at night, in addition to one's main job, usually to earn extra income. A person who moonlights may have little time left for sleep or leisure activities.",occup also call job activ often regular often perform exchang payment live mani peopl multipl job exampl person begin job becom employe volunt start busi etc durat job may rang temporari hourli odd job lifetim judg activ requir person mental physic effort work day work person train certain type job may profess teacher pilot judg typic job would subset someon career latter term much gener refer individu metaphor journey learn work aspect life one way differenti job career fact career end retir job end resign mani categor job possibl one categor job distinguish paid job teacher pilot unpaid job housework volunt mentor job requir specif train requir academ degre anoth type job refer moonlight practic hold addit job job often night addit one main job usual earn extra incom person moonlight may littl time left sleep leisur activ,B2
180,Charlie chaplin,"Charlie Chaplin was an English comic actor, filmmaker, and composer who rose to fame in the silent era. He is mostly famous for his screen persona ""the tramp"". Born on April 16, 1889 in London, Chaplin is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the film industry. He had been a productive and creative film maker for about 75 years before he died in 1977.
Chaplin suffered from poverty and hardship in his childhood. He was sent to a workhouse twice before the age of nine. His mother struggled financially when his father was absent. When he was 14, his mother was sent to a mental asylum.
Chaplin's first performances were at music halls as a stage actor and comedian at the age of 19. He went to the USA where he was scouted for the film industry, and began appearing in 1914 for Keystone Studios. He soon developed the Tramp persona and formed a large fan base. Chaplin directed his own films from an early stage, and continued to hone his craft.. By 1918, he was one of the best known figures in the film industry.
Chaplin wrote, directed, produced, edited, starred in, and composed the music for most of his films. He was a perfectionist, and his financial independence enabled him to spend years on the development and production of a picture.
In 1919, Chaplin co-founded the distribution company United Artists, which gave him complete control over his films. His first feature-length was:
In the 1930s, Chaplin refused to move to sound films. He produced instead:
Both without dialogue.
Later his films became more political by producing , The Great Dictator (1940) where he satirized Adolf Hitler.
The 1940s were a decade marked with controversy for Chaplin, and his popularity declined rapidly. He was accused of communist sympathies, while his involvement in a paternity suit and marriages to much younger women caused scandal. An FBI investigation was opened, and Chaplin was forced to leave the United States and settle in Switzerland.
Charlie Chaplin abandoned the Tramp in his later films, which include Monsieur Verdoux (1947), Limelight (1952), A King in New York (1957), and A Countess from Hong Kong (1967).
In 1972, as part of a renewed appreciation for his work, Chaplin received an Honorary Academy Award.",charli chaplin english comic actor filmmak compos rose fame silent era mostli famou screen persona tramp born april london chaplin consid one import figur histori film industri product creativ film maker year die chaplin suffer poverti hardship childhood sent workhous twice age nine mother struggl financi father absent mother sent mental asylum chaplin first perform music hall stage actor comedian age went usa scout film industri began appear keyston studio soon develop tramp persona form larg fan base chaplin direct film earli stage continu hone craft one best known figur film industri chaplin wrote direct produc edit star compos music film perfectionist financi independ enabl spend year develop product pictur chaplin distribut compani unit artist gave complet control film first chaplin refus move sound film produc instead without dialogu later film becam polit produc great dictat satir adolf hitler decad mark controversi chaplin popular declin rapidli accus communist sympathi involv patern suit marriag much younger woman caus scandal fbi investig open chaplin forc leav unit state settl switzerland charli chaplin abandon tramp later film includ monsieur verdoux limelight king new york countess hong kong part renew appreci work chaplin receiv honorari academi award,B2
181,Organizations world health organization,"The World Health Organization (WHO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations (UN) that is concerned with international public health. It was established on 7 April 1948, with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. Its predecessor, the Health Organization, was an agency of the League of Nations. The constitution of the World Health Organization had been signed by all 61 countries of the United Nations by 22 July 1946, with the first meeting of the World Health Assembly finishing on 24 July 1948
Since its creation, WHO has been responsible for playing a leading role iin smallpox eradication, which is an acute, highly infectious, often fatal disease caused by a poxvirus. Its current priorities include:

182,Thanksgiving,"Thanksgiving is celebrated in the USA and Canada. In The USA, it is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November every year. The Canadians celebrate it on the second Monday in October. It is associated with giving thanks to God. In the beginning people expressed gratitude for the harvest they reaped. It used to be a religious holiday but now it has become a secular celebration.
The most important part of the celebration is the dinner which includes the customary turkey served with cranberry sauce, and pumpkin. A lot of business goes on during this holiday. For example, restaurants take advantage of the holiday to sell turkey dinners
Families and friends usually get together for a large meal or dinner during Thanksgiving and have a lot of fun. That's why, the Thanksgiving holiday weekend is considered one of the busiest travel periods of the year. Students are given a four-day or five-day weekend vacation. Thanksgiving is also a paid holiday for most workers.",thanksgiv celebr usa canada usa celebr fourth thursday novemb everi year canadian celebr second monday octob associ give thank god begin peopl express gratitud harvest reap use religi holiday becom secular celebr import part celebr dinner includ customari turkey serv cranberri sauc pumpkin lot busi goe holiday exampl restaur take advantag holiday sell turkey dinner famili friend usual get togeth larg meal dinner thanksgiv lot fun thanksgiv holiday weekend consid one busiest travel period year student given weekend vacat thanksgiv also paid holiday worker,B2
183,Elephants ivory trade,"Elephants ivory trade poses a threat to the very existence of elephants. Ivory hunters were responsible for wiping out elephants in North Africa perhaps about 1,000 years ago, in much of South Africa in the 19th century and most of West Africa by the end of the 20th century. At the peak of the ivory trade, pre 20th century, during the colonization of Africa, around 800 to 1,000 tonnes of ivory was sent to Europe alone.
Elephant ivory has been exported from Africa and Asia for centuries with records going back to the 14th century BC. Throughout the colonization of Africa ivory was removed, often using slaves to carry the tusks, to be used for piano keys, billiard balls and other expressions of exotic wealth.
Although many ivory traders repeatedly claimed that the problem was habitat loss, it became glaringly clear that the threat was primarily the international ivory trade.
Should there be a legal trade in elephant ivory? This debate has been going on since at least 1989, when the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) voted to ""ban"" the international trade in ivory after a ferocious wave of poaching in Africa that left hundreds of thousands of elephants butchered.
While some conservationists say that a limited legal ivory trade is needed to satiate demand, especially in China, in a controlled manner, environmental activists ask whether elephants can survive a legal ivory trade. They argue that the 1989 ban must be kept in place to protect elephants, especially now that poaching has once again risen to catastrophic levels.",eleph ivori trade pose threat exist eleph ivori hunter respons wipe eleph north africa perhap year ago much south africa centuri west africa end centuri peak ivori trade pre centuri colon africa around tonn ivori sent europ alon eleph ivori export africa asia centuri record go back centuri bc throughout colon africa ivori remov often use slave carri tusk use piano key billiard ball express exot wealth although mani ivori trader repeatedli claim problem habitat loss becam glaringli clear threat primarili intern ivori trade legal trade eleph ivori debat go sinc least convent intern trade endang speci cite vote ban intern trade ivori feroci wave poach africa left hundr thousand eleph butcher conservationist say limit legal ivori trade need satiat demand especi china control manner environment activist ask whether eleph surviv legal ivori trade argu ban must kept place protect eleph especi poach risen catastroph level,B1
184,Salvador dali biography,"Salvador Dali was a prominent Spanish surrealist painter born in Figueres, Catalonia, on 11 May 1904. Dali's father was strict in the education of his children unlike the mother. Dali had a brother named Salvador who was born nine months before him and died of gastroenteritis. When he was five, Dalí was taken to his brother's grave and was told that he was his brother's reincarnation.
At an early age, Salvador Dali's parents encouraged him to produce highly sophisticated drawings and was sent to drawing school in Figueres, Spain, in 1916.
In February 1921, Dalí's mother died of breast cancer. Dalí was 16 years old; he later said his mother's death was the greatest blow he had experienced in his life. After her death, Dalí's father married his deceased wife's sister. Dalí did not resent this marriage, because he had a great love and respect for his aunt.
In 1922, Dalí moved to Madrid and studied at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando where he already drew attention as an eccentric and dandy. He was influenced by several different artistic styles, including Metaphysics and Cubism. Dalí was expelled from the Academy in 1926, shortly before his final exams when he was accused of starting an unrest.
Later, Dali visited Paris where he met Pablo Picasso whom he revered. Picasso had already heard favorable reports about Dalí from Joan Miró, a fellow Catalan who introduced him to many Surrealist friends. As he developed his own style over the next few years, Dalí made a number of works heavily influenced by Picasso and Miró.
In August 1929, Dalí met his lifelong and primary muse, inspiration, and future wife Gala. She was a Russian immigrant ten years his senior. They married in 1934. In addition to inspiring many artworks throughout her life, Gala would act as Dalí's business manager.
Dalí was a skilled draftsman, best known for the striking and bizarre images in his surrealist work. His painterly skills are often attributed to the influence of Renaissance masters. His best-known work, The Persistence of Memory, was completed in August 1931. Dalí's expansive artistic repertoire included film, sculpture, and photography, in collaboration with a range of artists in a variety of media.
Dalí attributed his ""love of everything that is gilded and excessive, my passion for luxury and my love of oriental clothes"" to an ""Arab lineage"", claiming that his ancestors were descended from the Moors.
Dalí was highly imaginative, and also enjoyed indulging in unusual and grandiose behavior. His eccentric manner and attention-grabbing public actions sometimes drew more attention than his artwork, to the dismay of those who held his work in high esteem, and to the irritation of his critics.
In 1980 at age 76, Dalí's health took a catastrophic turn. His right hand trembled terribly, with Parkinson-like symptoms. His near-senile wife allegedly had been dosing him with a dangerous cocktail of unprescribed medicine that damaged his nervous system, thus causing an untimely end to his artistic capacity.
His wife Gala died on 10 June 1982, at the age of 87. After Gala's death, Dalí lost much of his will to live. On the morning of 23 January 1989, while his favorite record of Tristan and Isolde played, Dalí died of heart failure at Figueres at the age of 84.",salvador dali promin spanish surrealist painter born figuer catalonia may dali father strict educ child unlik mother dali brother name salvador born nine month die gastroenter five dalí taken brother grave told brother reincarn earli age salvador dali parent encourag produc highli sophist draw sent draw school figuer spain februari dalí mother die breast cancer dalí year old later said mother death greatest blow experienc life death dalí father marri deceas wife sister dalí resent marriag great love respect aunt dalí move madrid studi real academia de bella art de san fernando alreadi drew attent eccentr dandi influenc sever differ artist style includ metaphys cubism dalí expel academi shortli final exam accus start unrest later dali visit pari met pablo picasso rever picasso alreadi heard favor report dalí joan miró fellow catalan introduc mani surrealist friend develop style next year dalí made number work heavili influenc picasso miró august dalí met lifelong primari muse inspir futur wife gala russian immigr ten year senior marri addit inspir mani artwork throughout life gala would act dalí busi manag dalí skill draftsman best known strike bizarr imag surrealist work painterli skill often attribut influenc renaiss master work persist memori complet august dalí expans artist repertoir includ film sculptur photographi collabor rang artist varieti medium dalí attribut love everyth gild excess passion luxuri love orient cloth arab lineag claim ancestor descend moor dalí highli imagin also enjoy indulg unusu grandios behavior eccentr manner public action sometim drew attent artwork dismay held work high esteem irrit critic age dalí health took catastroph turn right hand trembl terribl symptom wife allegedli dose danger cocktail unprescrib medicin damag nervou system thu caus untim end artist capac wife gala die june age gala death dalí lost much live morn januari favorit record tristan isold play dalí die heart failur figuer age,B2
185,Halloween,"Halloween (also spelled Hallowe'en) is an annual holiday celebrated on October 31. It has roots in the Celtic festival of Samhain and the Christian holy day of All Saints.
Halloween has origins in the ancient festival known as Samhain, which is derived from Old Irish and means roughly ""summer's end"". This was a Gaelic festival celebrated mainly in Ireland and Scotland.This festival celebrates the end of the ""lighter half"" of the year and beginning of the ""darker half"", and is sometimes regarded as the ""Celtic New Year"".The celebration has some elements of a festival of the dead. The ancient Celts believed that the border between this world and the Other world became thin on Samhain, allowing spirits (both harmless and harmful) to pass through. The family's ancestors were honored and invited home whilst harmful spirits were warded off. It is believed that the need to ward off harmful spirits led to the wearing of costumes and masks. Their purpose was to disguise oneself as a harmful spirit and thus avoid harm.
But where does the origin of the name ""halloween"" come from? Well The term Halloween, originally spelled Hallowe’en, is shortened from All Hallows' Even – e'en is a shortening of evening. It is now known as ""Eve of"" All Saints' Day, which is November 1st. As Chritianity started to spread, the church tried to supplant these pagan festivities with the Christian holiday (All Saints' Day) by moving it from May 13 to November 1. Although All Saints' Day is now considered to occur one day after Halloween, the two holidays were once celebrated on the same day.
Halloween is also related to A jack-o'-lantern (sometimes also spelled Jack O'Lantern) which is typically a carved pumpkin. In a jack-o'-lantern, typically the top is cut off, and the inside flesh then scooped out; an image, usually a monstrous face, is carved onto the outside surface, and the lid replaced. At night, a light is placed inside to illuminate the effect.
Trick-or-treating is a customary celebration for children on Halloween. Children go in costume from house to house, asking for treats such as candy or sometimes money, with the question, ""Trick or treat?"" The word ""trick"" refers to a (mostly idle) threat to perform mischief on the homeowners or their property if no treat is given. In some parts of Ireland and Scotland children still go guising. In this custom the child performs some sort of show, i.e. sings a song or tells a ghost story, in order to earn their treats.

186,Saint valentine day,"Hallmark holiday refers to a holiday that is perceived to exist mainly for commercial reasons, rather than to celebrate a traditionally significant religious or secular event. Although many people view these celebrations in a negative way, others have positive views. On the negative side, hallmark holidays don't really celebrate an important event, and only exist for companies to make a lot of money.  On the positive side, the term describes the perfect holiday in which family, friends, and fun come first.  Everyday problems, worries, and stress can be put aside.  Valentine's Day, which is celebrated on February 14, is usually considered to be one of the hallmark holidays.
In Valentine's Day billions of cards are sent. It is also an opportunity for customers to buy chocolates, flowers, engagement rings, romantic dinners, and so on.  This commercial aspect can be traced back to the 19th century when printing technology improved to cheaply mass-produce greeting cards.  But the origin of the celebration is much more ancient and can be traced back to a Roman festival called ""Lupercalia"" which was held in mid-February every year.  The celebration purified new life in the spring. Around the third century A.D., the holiday became associated with Saint Valentine, although it isn't exactly clear how.
A popular explanation of the link between Saint Valentine and the Holiday says that at the time of the Roman ""Lupercalia"" Festival marriage was a common tradition, but when Claudius became Emperor he changed all of that. He outlawed all marriages because he was afraid that men would refuse their duty to fight because they would not want to leave their wives behind. Young couples still fell in love though and still wished to marry and they took these desires to the Catholic Bishop Valentine who, understanding love, began to secretly marry couples. When Claudius found out, he arrested Valentine and sentenced him to death. While waiting in prison, Valentine began exchanging letters with the prisoner's daughter and soon had fallen in love with her. The day he was to be beheaded, he wrote her one last note and signed it: ""From Your Valentine"".
In 496 A.D. Christianity had taken over Rome and Pope Gelasius outlawed the pagan Lupercian Festival. Knowing it’s popularity, he looked to replace it with something more ""appropriate"" and set aside a day in February to honor the martyr St. Valentine. Even though in 1969 the church removed St. Valentines Day from it’s calendar of ""official"" holidays, it is still widely celebrated today. And although Valentine's Day has become quite commercial, it still contains an important aspect shared by all of the best holidays - time spent thinking of and being with the one you love.",hallmark holiday refer holiday perceiv exist mainli commerci reason rather celebr tradit signific religi secular event although mani peopl view celebr neg way other posit view neg side hallmark holiday realli celebr import event exist compani make lot money posit side term describ perfect holiday famili friend fun come first everyday problem worri stress put asid valentin day celebr februari usual consid one hallmark holiday valentin day billion card sent also opportun custom buy chocol flower engag ring romant dinner commerci aspect trace back centuri print technolog improv cheapli greet card origin celebr much ancient trace back roman festiv call lupercalia held everi year celebr purifi new life spring around third centuri holiday becam associ saint valentin although exactli clear popular explan link saint valentin holiday say time roman lupercalia festiv marriag common tradit claudiu becam emperor chang outlaw marriag afraid men would refus duti fight would want leav wive behind young coupl still fell love though still wish marri took desir cathol bishop valentin understand love began secretli marri coupl claudiu found arrest valentin sentenc death wait prison valentin began exchang letter prison daughter soon fallen love day behead wrote one last note sign valentin christian taken rome pope gelasiu outlaw pagan lupercian festiv know popular look replac someth appropri set asid day februari honor martyr valentin even though church remov valentin day calendar offici holiday still wide celebr today although valentin day becom quit commerci still contain import aspect share best holiday time spent think one love,C1
187,New york city,"New York is the most populous city in the United States and the center of the New York metropolitan area, the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States and one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. The city is referred to as New York City or the City of New York to distinguish it from the State of New York, of which it is a part. It has also been called by many nicknames such as the “City that Never Sleeps” and the “Center of the Universe.” But the Big Apple is the most famous nickname.
A global power city, New York exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment. The home of the United Nations Headquarters, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.
New York traces its roots back to 1624 when it was founded as a trading post by colonists of the Dutch Republic. It was named New Amsterdam in 1626. The city and its surroundings came under English control in 1664. New York served as the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790. It has been the country's largest city since 1790.
The Statue of Liberty, which is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in the middle of New York Harbor, in Manhattan, was designed by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and dedicated on October 28, 1886. It was a gift to the United States from the people of France.

188,Women changed the world,"Who can regret the importance of women in our every day life? Women help not only with the housework but also in the progress of countries. They have reached a high place comparable to that of men in all fields: politics, business, sport, art, literature etc.
Here is a list of six women who made history:

1. Benazir Bhutto was a Pakistani-born politician, with Pakistani and Kurdish origin, who chaired the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), a centre-left political party in Pakistan. Bhutto was the first woman elected to lead a Muslim state, having twice been Prime Minister of Pakistan (1988–1990; 1993–1996). She was Pakistan's first and to date only female prime minister. she was assassinated on 27 December 2007, after departing a PPP rally in the Pakistani city of Rawalpindi, two weeks before the scheduled Pakistani general election of 2008 in which she was a leading opposition candidate

2. Indira Gandhi was born Indira Nehru to Jawaharlal Nehru. She was the third Prime Minister of the Republic of India for three consecutive terms from 1966 to 1977 and for a fourth term from 1980 until her assassination in 1984, a total of fifteen years. India's only female prime minister to date, she remains the world's longest serving female Prime Minister as of 2011. She was also the only Indian Prime Minister to have declared an emergency in order to 'rule by decree' and the only Indian Prime Minister to have been imprisoned.

3. Khadijah bint Khuwaylid was the first wife of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Khadijah successfully managed her father's business interests and preserved the family's fortune. It is said that when the Quraysh's trade caravans gathered to embark upon their lengthy and arduous journey either to Syria during the summer or to Yemen during the winter, Khadijah's caravan equalled the caravans of all other traders of the Quraish put together. She is important in Islam as Muhammad's first wife, and one of the ""mothers of the believers"" .

4. In 1975 Margaret Thatcher became Leader of the Conservative Party and became the first woman to head a major UK political party. Following the 1979 general election she became Britain's first female Prime Minister. Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation, particularly of the financial sector, flexible labour markets, and the sale or closure of state-owned companies and withdrawal of subsidies to others. She survived an assassination attempt in 1984. She took a hard line against trade unions, and her tough rhetoric in opposition to the Soviet Union earned her the nickname of the ""Iron Lady"".

5. Rosa Louise McCauley Parks (February 4, 1913 – October 24, 2005) was an African-American civil rights activist, whom the U.S. Congress called ""the first lady of civil rights"", and ""the mother of the freedom movement"". On December 1, 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama, Parks refused to obey bus driver James Blake's order that she give up her seat to make room for a white passenger. Parks' act of defiance became an important symbol of the modern Civil Rights Movement and Parks became an international icon of resistance to racial segregation. She organized and collaborated with civil rights leaders, including boycott leader Martin Luther King, Jr., helping to launch him to national prominence in the civil rights movement.

6. Simone de Beauvoir was a French existentialist philosopher, public intellectual, and social theorist. She wrote novels, essays, biographies, an autobiography in several volumes, and monographs on philosophy, politics, and social issues. She is now best known for her metaphysical novels, including She Came to Stay and The Mandarins, and for her 1949 treatise The Second Sex, a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary feminism. She is also noted for her lifelong polyamorous relationship with Jean-Paul Sartre.",regret import woman everi day life woman help housework also progress countri reach high place compar men field polit busi sport art literatur etc list six woman made histori benazir bhutto politician pakistani kurdish origin chair pakistan peopl parti ppp polit parti pakistan bhutto first woman elect lead muslim state twice prime minist pakistan pakistan first date femal prime minist assassin decemb depart ppp ralli pakistani citi rawalpindi two week schedul pakistani gener elect lead opposit candid indira gandhi born indira nehru jawaharl nehru third prime minist republ india three consecut term fourth term assassin total fifteen year india femal prime minist date remain world longest serv femal prime minist also indian prime minist declar emerg order decre indian prime minist imprison khadijah bint khuwaylid first wife islam prophet muhammad khadijah success manag father busi interest preserv famili fortun said quraysh trade caravan gather embark upon lengthi arduou journey either syria summer yemen winter khadijah caravan equal caravan trader quraish put togeth import islam muhammad first wife one mother believ margaret thatcher becam leader conserv parti becam first woman head major uk polit parti follow gener elect becam britain first femal prime minist polit philosophi econom polici emphasis deregul particularli financi sector flexibl labour market sale closur compani withdraw subsidi other surviv assassin attempt took hard line trade union tough rhetor opposit soviet union earn nicknam iron ladi rosa louis mccauley park februari octob civil right activist congress call first ladi civil right mother freedom movement decemb montgomeri alabama park refus obey bu driver jame blake order give seat make room white passeng park act defianc becam import symbol modern civil right movement park becam intern icon resist racial segreg organ collabor civil right leader includ boycott leader martin luther king help launch nation promin civil right movement simon de beauvoir french existentialist philosoph public intellectu social theorist wrote novel essay biographi autobiographi sever volum monograph philosophi polit social issu best known metaphys novel includ came stay mandarin treatis second sex detail analysi woman oppress foundat tract contemporari femin also note lifelong polyamor relationship sartr,C2
189,The common cold,"The common cold, also known simply as the cold, is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the nose. It is also possible that the throat, sinuses, and voice box get also affected. It is the most frequent infectious disease in humans. The average adult gets two to four colds a year, while the average child may get six to eight. They occur more commonly during the winter. These infections have been with humanity throughout history.
Signs and symptoms may begin less than two days following exposure. They include coughing, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, headache, and fever. People usually recover in seven to ten days. Some symptoms may last up to three weeks. In those with other health problems, pneumonia may occasionally develop.
Well over 200 virus strains are implicated in the cause of the common cold; the rhinoviruses are the most common. They spread through the air during close contact with infected people and indirectly through contact with infected objects. Risk factors include going to daycare, not sleeping well, and psychological stress. Symptoms are mostly due to the body's immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves.
In the early stages of infection, it can be difficult to distinguish between the common cold and influenza. The latter is commonly referred to as the flu and is usually a more severe disease than the cold. In fact, influenza is a mixture of symptoms of common cold and pneumonia. Influenza patients may suffer from fever, body aches, headache, diarrhoea, sore throat, runny nose, vomiting, and fatigue.
There is no vaccine for the common cold. The primary methods of prevention are the following:
Some evidence supports the importance of using face masks.
No cure for the common cold exists, but the symptoms can be treated. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may help with pain. Antibiotics should not be used. In addition, evidence from research does not support any benefit from cough medicines.",common cold also known simpli cold viral infecti diseas upper respiratori tract primarili affect nose also possibl throat sinus voic box get also affect frequent infecti diseas human averag adult get two four cold year averag child may get six eight occur commonli winter infect human throughout histori sign symptom may begin le two day follow exposur includ cough sore throat runni nose sneez headach fever peopl usual recov seven ten day symptom may last three week health problem pneumonia may occasion develop well viru strain implic caus common cold rhinovirus common spread air close contact infect peopl indirectli contact infect object risk factor includ go daycar sleep well psycholog stress symptom mostli due bodi immun respons infect rather tissu destruct virus earli stage infect difficult distinguish common cold influenza latter commonli refer flu usual sever diseas cold fact influenza mixtur symptom common cold pneumonia influenza patient may suffer fever bodi ach headach diarrhoea sore throat runni nose vomit fatigu vaccin common cold primari method prevent follow evid support import use face mask cure common cold exist symptom treat drug nsaid ibuprofen may help pain antibiot use addit evid research support benefit cough medicin,B2
190,Christopher marlowe biography,"Christopher Marlowe was an English playwright, poet, and translator of the Elizabethan era. He was born in Canterbury, England, in 1564. He died young at the age of twenty-nine and his career as a playwright lasted only six years. His work, particularly, the play The Tragicall History of Doctor Faustus, secured his lasting legacy. His achievement had a great impact on William Shakespeare, who was born in the same year as Marlowe and who rose to become the pre-eminent Elizabethan playwright after Marlowe's mysterious early death.
Marlowe was born in Canterbury to shoemaker John Marlowe and his wife Catherine. His date of birth is not known but he was baptized on February 26th, 1564 and is likely to have been born a few days before, making him two months older than William Shakespeare, who was baptized on 26 April 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon. Marlowe attended The King's School in Canterbury and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he studied on a scholarship and received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1584. In 1587, the university hesitated to award him his Master of Arts degree because of a rumor that he had converted to Roman Catholicism and would soon attend college elsewhere. These rumors were set to rest and Marlowe was awarded his Master of Arts when the Privy Council intervened on his behalf, praising him for his ""faithful dealing"" and ""good service"" to the Queen. The nature of Marlowe's service was not specified by the Council, but its letter to the Cambridge authorities has provoked considerable speculation, particularly the theory that Marlowe was operating as a secret agent working for Sir Francis Walsingham. No direct evidence supports this theory, although the Council's letter itself is evidence that Marlowe had served the government in some secret capacity.
Some biographers think that Marlowe was a government spy. His frequent lengthy absences from university and the Privy Council's intervention to the university to grant him his Master's degree in spite of the rumor that he had converted to catholicism have provoked much speculation that Marlow had become a secret agent working for Sir Francis Walsingham's intelligence service. In the absence of hard evidence that he was, in fact, a spy, the debate is still active about the nature of his service to the queen. What biographers are certain about is that after attaining his master's degree, Marlowe moved to London and took up writing full-time.
In spite of his short life, Christopher Marlowe wrote many successful plays in an incredibly short six-year literary career. Some scholars contend that Marlowe started writing for the theater after 1587 while occasionally serving the government. Marlowe's plays are known for the use of blank verse and their overreaching protagonists and controversial themes. His first play, Dido, Queen of Carthage, was not published until 1594. The play was performed by the Children of the Chapel, a company of boy actors, between 1587 and 1593. His second play was the two-part Tamburlaine the Great (c. 1587; published 1590). This was Marlowe's first play to be performed on the regular stage in London and is among the first English plays in blank verse. Marlowe's most famous play is The Tragicall History of Doctor. It is based on the German Faustbuch, Doctor Faustus. It is seen as the first dramatized version of the Faust legend, in which a man sells his soul to the devil in exchange for knowledge and power.
Marlowe was arrested for 'atheism' or 'heresy' on Sunday, May 20, 1593. At that time heresy was a serious crime that would end up with a grave penalty, namely burning at the stake. Although the offense was grave, Marlowe was not imprisoned or tortured. He was set free on the condition that he report daily to an officer of the court.
Strangely, however, Marlowe was killed by Ingram Frizer on May 30. Frizer was with Nicholas Skeres and Robert Poley, and all three men were tied to one of the Walsinghams--either Sir Francis Walsingham, the man who hired him to work for the secret service of the queen, or a relative of his, presumably also a spy.",christoph marlow english playwright poet translat elizabethan era born canterburi england die young age career playwright last six year work particularli play tragical histori doctor faustu secur last legaci achiev great impact william shakespear born year marlow rose becom elizabethan playwright marlow mysteri earli death marlow born canterburi shoemak john marlow wife catherin date birth known baptiz februari like born day make two month older william shakespear baptiz april marlow attend king school canterburi corpu christi colleg cambridg studi scholarship receiv bachelor art degre univers hesit award master art degre rumor convert roman catholic would soon attend colleg elsewher rumor set rest marlow award master art privi council interven behalf prais faith deal good servic queen natur marlow servic specifi council letter cambridg author provok consider specul particularli theori marlow oper secret agent work sir franci walsingham direct evid support theori although council letter evid marlow serv govern secret capac biograph think marlow govern spi frequent lengthi absenc univers privi council intervent univers grant master degre spite rumor convert catholic provok much specul marlow becom secret agent work sir franci walsingham intellig servic absenc hard evid fact spi debat still activ natur servic queen biograph certain attain master degre marlow move london took write spite short life christoph marlow wrote mani success play incred short literari career scholar contend marlow start write theater occasion serv govern marlow play known use blank vers overreach protagonist controversi theme first play dido queen carthag publish play perform child chapel compani boy actor second play tamburlain great publish marlow first play perform regular stage london among first english play blank vers marlow famou play tragical histori doctor base german faustbuch doctor faustu seen first dramat version faust legend man sell soul devil exchang knowledg power marlow arrest sunday may time heresi seriou crime would end grave penalti name burn stake although offens grave marlow imprison tortur set free condit report daili offic court strang howev marlow kill ingram frizer may frizer nichola skere robert poley three men tie one walsingham either sir franci walsingham man hire work secret servic queen rel presum also spi,C1
191,Smoking and health problems,"Smoking is one of the most common forms of recreational drug use. It is a habit which consists of breathing in a smoke from a burned substance. This substance contains the active alkaloid nicotine which is absorbed into the bloodstream. It may cause various diseases and dysfunctions. Tobacco smoking is the most popular form of smoking. It is practiced by over one billion people globally, of whom the majority are in the developing world. Less common drugs for smoking include cannabis and opium. Some of the substances are classified as hard narcotics, like heroin, but the use of these substances is very limited as they are usually not commercially available.
The practice of smoking can be dated to as early as 5000 BC, and has been recorded in many different cultures across the world. Early smoking evolved in association with religious ceremonies; as offerings to deities, in cleansing rituals or to allow shamans and priests to alter their minds for various religious purposes. After the European exploration and conquest of the Americas, the practice of smoking tobacco quickly spread to the rest of the world.
Smoking has negative health effects, because smoke inhalation inherently poses challenges to various physiologic processes such as respiration. Diseases related to tobacco smoking have been shown to kill approximately half of long term smokers when compared to average mortality rates faced by non-smokers. A 2007 report states that, each year, about 4.9 million people worldwide die as a result of smoking. It is among the leading causes of many diseases such as lung cancer, heart attacks, erectile dysfunction, and birth defects. The health hazards of smoking have caused many countries to institute high taxes on tobacco products, run ads to discourage use, limit ads that promote use, and provide help with quitting for those who do smoke",smoke one common form recreat drug use habit consist breath smoke burn substanc substanc contain activ alkaloid nicotin absorb bloodstream may caus variou diseas dysfunct tobacco smoke popular form smoke practic one billion peopl global major develop world le common drug smoke includ cannabi opium substanc classifi hard narcot like heroin use substanc limit usual commerci avail practic smoke date earli bc record mani differ cultur across world earli smoke evolv associ religi ceremoni offer deiti clean ritual allow shaman priest alter mind variou religi purpos european explor conquest america practic smoke tobacco quickli spread rest world smoke neg health effect smoke inhal inher pose challeng variou physiolog process respir diseas relat tobacco smoke shown kill approxim half long term smoker compar averag mortal rate face report state year million peopl worldwid die result smoke among lead caus mani diseas lung cancer heart attack erectil dysfunct birth defect health hazard smoke caus mani countri institut high tax tobacco product run ad discourag use limit ad promot use provid help quit smoke,C1
192,Earth day,"Many countries around the world celebrate Earth Day. It is a day that is meant to raise awareness and appreciation about the Earth's natural environment.
The first Earth Day was held in the USA. It was founded by United States Senator Gaylord Nelson as an environmental teach-in - a sort of general educational forum or seminar. That was on April 22, 1970. While this first Earth Day was focused on the United States, an organization launched by Denis Hayes, who was the original national coordinator in 1970, took it international in 1990 and organized events in 141 nations.
Earth Day is now coordinated globally by the Earth Day Network, and is celebrated in more than 175 countries every year. Numerous communities celebrate Earth Week, an entire week of activities focused on environmental issues.

The different parts of pizza consist of the crast, cheese and the topings
It is the bottom of the pizza. It may vary widely according to style.
It is traditionally plain, but may also be seasoned with garlic or herbs, or stuffed with cheese.

194,Joker movie 2019,"Joker is a 2019 American psychological thriller movie directed by Todd Phillips, who co-wrote the screenplay with Scott Silver. The film is inspired by the characters of an American comic book company referred to as DC Comics. The movie stars Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker. The supporting roles are played by Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Frances Conroy, Brett Cullen, Glenn Fleshler, Bill Camp, Shea Whigham, and Marc Maron. The movie was produced by Warner Bros. Pictures, DC Films, and Joint Effort in association with Bron Creative and Village Roadshow Pictures, and distributed by Warner Bros.
Phillips conceived Joker in 2016 and wrote the script with Silver throughout 2017. The two were inspired by 1970s character studies and the films of Martin Scorsese, who was initially attached to the project as a producer. The graphic novel Batman: The Killing Joke (1988) was the basis for the premise.
The story is set in 1981 and follows Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian who turns to a life of crime and chaos in Gotham City. Always feeling alone in a crowd, the joker looks for getting connected to others as he walks the streets. He lives a poor life with his mother. He is isolated, bullied and disregarded by society. As a result, Arthur embarks on a slow descent into madness as he transforms into the criminal mastermind known as the joker.
Joker premiered at the 76th Venice International Film Festival on August 31, 2019, where it won the Golden Lion and was released in the United States on October 4, 2019. The film polarized critics; while Phoenix's performance was praised, the dark tone, portrayal of mental illness, and handling of violence divided responses. Joker also generated concerns of inspiring real-world violence. The movie theater where the 2012 Aurora, Colorado mass shooting occurred during a screening of The Dark Knight Rises refused to show it. The film set box office records for an October release and has grossed over $934 million worldwide, making it the seventh highest-grossing film of 2019 and the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time.",joker american psycholog thriller movi direct todd phillip screenplay scott silver film inspir charact american comic book compani refer dc comic movi star joaquin phoenix joker support role play robert de niro zazi beetz franc conroy brett cullen glenn fleshler bill camp shea whigham marc maron movi produc warner pictur dc film joint effort associ bron creativ villag roadshow pictur distribut warner phillip conceiv joker wrote script silver throughout two inspir charact studi film martin scorses initi attach project produc graphic novel batman kill joke basi premis stori set follow arthur fleck fail comedian turn life crime chao gotham citi alway feel alon crowd joker look get connect other walk street live poor life mother isol bulli disregard societi result arthur embark slow descent mad transform crimin mastermind known joker joker premier venic intern film festiv august golden lion releas unit state octob film polar critic phoenix perform prais dark tone portray mental ill handl violenc divid respons joker also gener concern inspir violenc movi theater aurora colorado mass shoot occur screen dark knight rise refus show film set box offic record octob releas gross million worldwid make seventh film film time,C1
195,The Monkey and the Crocodile,"Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey who resided on a jamoon (berry) tree, which was on the banks of a river. In the same forest, there lived a crocodile and his wife. One day, the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree. The kindhearted monkey offered him some fruits. The crocodile came back the next day for more fruits, as he loved them. As days passed by, the crocodile and the monkey became good friends.
One day, the monkey sent some fruits for the crocodile’s wife. She ate the fruits and liked them, but was jealous, as she didn’t like her husband spending time with the monkey. She told her husband, “If the fruits are so juicy, I wonder how sweet the monkey’s heart would be. Get me the heart of the monkey.” The crocodile was not willing to kill his friend, but had no choice.
He invited the monkey to his house for dinner and that his wife would like to meet him. The monkey was happy, but couldn’t swim, so the crocodile took him on his back. The crocodile was happy that he had tricked the monkey, however, while talking, he blurted out the real reason for taking the monkey home. The clever monkey said, “You should have told me earlier, I left my heart on the tree. We must go back and get it.” The crocodile believed him and took him back to the tree. Thus, the clever monkey saved his life.

196,The Stork and the Crab,"Once upon a time, there lived a stork who used to pick fishes from the pond beside him, and eat them. However, as he grew older, he found it difficult to catch a single fish. In order to feed himself, he thought of a plan. He told the fish, frogs, and crabs, that some men are planning to fill the pond and grow crops, and that’s why there won’t be any fish in the pond. He also told them how sad he felt about this and that he will miss them all. The fish were sad and asked the stork to help them. The stork promised to take all of them to a bigger pond. However, he told them, “As I am old, I can take only a few of you at one go.” The stork would take the fishes to a rock, kill them, and eat them up. Every time he was hungry, he would take a few of them to the rock and eat them.
There lived a crab in the pond, who wanted to go to the bigger pond too. The stork thought of eating the crab for a change and agreed on helping him. On the way, the crab asked the stork, “Where is the big pond?” The stork laughed and pointed to the rock, which was filled with fish bones. The crab realised that the stork would kill him, and so quickly thought of a plan to save himself. He caught the stork’s neck and did not let it go until the stork died.

199,The Elephant and the Sparrows,"A sparrow couple had a beautiful nest with eggs, on a tall, strong tree, and were expecting their little ones soon. However, an arrogant elephant soon visited the area and shook the tree so hard, that he managed to destroy the nest and the eggs. Angered and saddened by this, the sparrows decided to seek revenge.
They asked their woodpecker friend to help them. The woodpecker, along with his friends, the fly and the frog, devised a plan. The frog asked the fly to buzz near the elephant’s ear. He said, “When the elephant closes his eyes, woodpecker, you must pierce his eyes. The elephant will stand up and try to find water. I will croak far away and the elephant will think there’s water around and reach the place. We will create a big pit and the elephant will fall into it.”
At sunset, they worked as per the plan, and the elephant fell into the pit and died.

However, the mice living in the village decided to stay and make it their home. On the outskirts of this village, there was a lake, where a herd of elephants visited regularly to bathe and drink water. Since the village was on the way to this lake, the elephants trampled the mice while walking there. So, the king of mice decided to meet the elephants. He told them, ” O elephants, as you travel through the village, many mice are trampled. We will be very grateful if you could please consider changing your route. We will remember and return the favour when you are in need.”
The elephant king laughed, “We are giant elephants. What favour can you mice return? Nevertheless, we honour your request and change our route.”
After a few days, the elephants got trapped and entangled in nets that were set up by hunters. They struggled hard to escape, but in vain. The elephant king remembered the promise made by the king of mice. So, he sent a fellow elephant who got lucky and was not trapped, to ask the mice king to come and help them.
Soon, all the mice came and started nibbling the nets, and freed the elephants. The king of the elephants couldn’t thank the mice enough!
Moral of the Story: A friend in need is a friend indeed.

202,The Jackal and the Drum,"Once upon a time, a jackal wandered away from his jungle and reached a deserted battlefield. He was very hungry, and so he started looking for food, when heard a strange sound. The jackal got scared and decided to run away, but then he thought, “Let me carefully see who is making that sound.” As he looked around, he found an abandoned drum lying next to a tree, and as the wind blew, the branches of the tree rubbed against it, making the sound.

203,The Foolish Lion and the Clever Rabbit,"Once upon a time, there lived a greedy lion who attacked and killed animals, because of which every animal in the jungle was very afraid of him. One day, they decided that each animal would go to the lion, per day, as his prey. The lion agreed. When it was the rabbit’s turn, they decided to send the wise old one. He travelled slowly and reached the lion’s den before sunset. The lion furiously asked him, “Why are you so late?” The rabbit answered, ”A group of rabbits were coming to you, but on their way, the others were attacked by another ferocious lion. I managed to escape and came here.” The rabbit also mentioned that the other lion was challenging this one.
The lion was extremely angry and asked the rabbit to take him to meet the new lion. The wise rabbit took the lion to a deep well, and showed him his own reflection. As the lion growled, his reflection did the same. He considered this reflection to be his enemy. The enraged lion jumped into the well to attack the other lion, and ended up dying. Thus, the wise old rabbit saved himself, and all the animals in the forest.

204,The Tortoise and the Geese,"Once upon a time, beside a lake, there lived a tortoise and two geese who were great friends. As the lake was drying, the geese decided to migrate to a new place. The tortoise also wanted to move with them, but he couldn’t fly, and so he pleaded the geese to take him with them. After trying really hard to convince them, finally, the geese agreed. They held a stick with their beaks and asked the tortoise to hold the stick with his mouth, warning him to not open his mouth and let go of the stick.
As they flew high, some onlookers thought that the tortoise was kidnapped and commented: “Oh, the poor tortoise!” This angered the tortoise and he immediately opened his mouth to say something back. As soon as he did, he fell to the ground and died.

Instead of staying on the field, he would sneak into the villagers’ farms and eat the vegetables growing, before sneaking back home. The donkey met a jackal, and they became good friends. They decided to hunt together, and the fat donkey would break the fence to eat vegetables, while the jackal hunted the farm animals. One night, the donkey told the jackal that he felt like singing. The jackal pleaded with him not to sing, as they would get caught. However, the donkey got annoyed and insisted on singing. He opened his mouth and began to bray loudly, and the jackal immediately ran away. The farmers, on hearing the donkey bray, came rushing out and thrashed him for eating their vegetables. The farmers tied a mortar on the donkey, and as he walked home, the jackal joked about the farmers gifting the donkey a necklace for his singing.

206,A conceited lioness,"A lion and a lioness lived together in a forest. They also had a child. They loved each other very much. The lion was intelligent and courteous to other animals. 
Whenever there was a fight between two animals, only the lion would go to resolve the dispute. But, the lioness was very conceited and always used to degrade other animals. That’s why no animal liked her.
One day the lion went out somewhere and the baby of the lioness got lost due to which the lioness was very upset. 
She started searching for it. Whenever she asked the other animal about her baby, she didn’t get any reply. As a result, she deeply regretted her behavior towards other animals and apologized to all.

209,A greedy shopkeeper,"In a village, a shopkeeper used to sell his fruits at high prices, which brought him a lot of profit. But, he wasn’t happy with it because he wanted to earn more. 
So, he thought of wrongdoing and whenever a customer came to buy fruits from him, he cleverly reduced the weight by 150 gms from each. Now, he was earning more money. One day his friend came to buy some fruits from him and he did the same to his friend. 
When his friend got suspicious, the shopkeeper told him that it was his illusion.
His friend went to another shop and checked the weight of those fruits. He found that the weight of the fruits was reduced by 150 gms. Consequently, he came back to his friend’s shop and scolded him for this dishonesty in front of other customers, leaving him very embarrassed.

He knew the mantra of subduing people, but he was worried that he should tell this mantra to a person who would never misuse it. That’s why he called some abstemious and intelligent boys of that village. 
He told them that whoever will be successful in the work given by me, I’ll tell him the mantra of subduing people. 
As a result, if there is any trouble in the future, you can use it.
All the boys were very excited and ready for the task. Pandit said that whoever does penance with me for seven days without eating or drinking anything, I’ll tell him that mantra. All the boys did their best, but only one boy was successful to do so as his willpower was very strong.
